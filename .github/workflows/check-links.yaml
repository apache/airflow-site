name: Check Doc Links

# This workflow checks all links from Airflow doc via Lychee: https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee
# The check is done directly from website in case build process creates / transforms links
# It has a schedule to run at least once a day in order to detect dangling external links in case there
# is no activity on this repo itself.
