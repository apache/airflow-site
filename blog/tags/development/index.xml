      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;documenting-local-development-environment-of-apache-airflow&#34;&gt;Documenting local development environment of Apache Airflow&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From Sept to November 2019 I have been participating in a wonderful initiative, &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs&#34;&gt;Google Season of Docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had a pleasure to contribute to the Apache Airflow open source project as a technical writer.&#xA;My initial assignment was an extension to the GitHub-based Contribution guide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the very first days I have been pretty closely involved into inter-project communications&#xA;via emails/slack and had regular 1:1s with my mentor, Jarek Potiuk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-story-behind-the-airflow-breeze-tool&#34;&gt;The story behind the Airflow Breeze tool&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Initially, we started contributing to this fantastic open-source project [Apache Airflow] with a team of three which then grew to five. When we kicked it off a year ago, I realized pretty soon where the biggest bottlenecks and areas for improvement in terms of productivity were. Even with the help of our client, who provided us with a “homegrown” development environment it took us literally days to set it up and learn some basics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
