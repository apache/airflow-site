      <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs&#34;&gt;Google Season of Docs&lt;/a&gt; (GSoD) almost by accident, thanks to my extensive HackerNews and Twitter addiction.  I was familiar with the Google Summer of Code but not with this program.&#xA;It turns out it was the inaugural phase. I read the details, and the process felt a lot like GSoC except that this was about documentation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-me&#34;&gt;About Me&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been writing tech articles on medium as well as my blog for the past 1.5 years.  Blogging helps me test my understanding of the concepts as untangling the toughest of ideas in simple sentences requires a considerable time investment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
