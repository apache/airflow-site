.. py:class:: S3KeySensor(*, bucket_key: str, bucket_name: Optional[str] = None, wildcard_match: bool = False, aws_conn_id: str = 'aws_default', verify: Optional[Union[str, bool]] = None, **kwargs)

   Bases: :class:`airflow.sensors.base.BaseSensorOperator`

   Waits for a key (a file-like instance on S3) to be present in a S3 bucket.
   S3 being a key/value it does not support folders. The path is just a key
   a resource.

   :param bucket_key: The key being waited on. Supports full s3:// style url
       or relative path from root level. When it's specified as a full s3://
       url, please leave bucket_name as `None`.
   :type bucket_key: str
   :param bucket_name: Name of the S3 bucket. Only needed when ``bucket_key``
       is not provided as a full s3:// url.
   :type bucket_name: str
   :param wildcard_match: whether the bucket_key should be interpreted as a
       Unix wildcard pattern
   :type wildcard_match: bool
   :param aws_conn_id: a reference to the s3 connection
   :type aws_conn_id: str
   :param verify: Whether or not to verify SSL certificates for S3 connection.
       By default SSL certificates are verified.
       You can provide the following values:

       - ``False``: do not validate SSL certificates. SSL will still be used
                (unless use_ssl is False), but SSL certificates will not be
                verified.
       - ``path/to/cert/bundle.pem``: A filename of the CA cert bundle to uses.
                You can specify this argument if you want to use a different
                CA cert bundle than the one used by botocore.
   :type verify: bool or str

      Create and return an S3Hook




.. py:class:: S3KeySizeSensor(*, check_fn: Optional[Callable[..., bool]] = None, **kwargs)

   Bases: :class:`airflow.providers.amazon.aws.sensors.s3_key.S3KeySensor`

   Waits for a key (a file-like instance on S3) to be present and be more than
   some size in a S3 bucket.
   S3 being a key/value it does not support folders. The path is just a key
   a resource.

   :param bucket_key: The key being waited on. Supports full s3:// style url
       or relative path from root level. When it's specified as a full s3://
       url, please leave bucket_name as `None`.

   :param verify: Whether or not to verify SSL certificates for S3 connection.
       By default SSL certificates are verified.

   :type verify: bool or str
   :type check_fn: Optional[Callable[..., bool]]
   :param check_fn: Function that receives the list of the S3 objects,
       and returns the boolean:
       - ``True``: a certain criteria is met
       - ``False``: the criteria isn't met
       **Example**: Wait for any S3 object size more than 1 megabyte  ::

           def check_fn(self, data: List) -> bool:
               return any(f.get('Size', 0) > 1048576 for f in data if isinstance(f, dict))

   
   .. method:: poke(self, context)



   
   .. method:: get_files(self, s3_hook: S3Hook, delimiter: Optional[str] = '/')

      Gets a list of files in the bucket



   
   .. method:: check_fn(self, data: List, object_min_size: Optional[Union[int, float]] = 0)

      Default function for checking that S3 Objects have size more than 0

      :param data: List of the objects in S3 bucket.
      :type data: list
      :param object_min_size: Checks if the objects sizes are greater then this value.
      :type object_min_size: int
