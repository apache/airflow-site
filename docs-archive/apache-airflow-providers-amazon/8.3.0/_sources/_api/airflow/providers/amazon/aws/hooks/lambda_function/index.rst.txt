.. py:class:: LambdaHook(*args, **kwargs)


   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.amazon.aws.hooks.base_aws.AwsBaseHook`

   Interact with AWS Lambda.

   Provide thin wrapper around :external+boto3:py:class:`boto3.client("lambda") <Lambda.Client>`.

   Additional arguments (such as ``aws_conn_id``) may be specified and
   are passed down to the underlying AwsBaseHook.

   .. py:method:: invoke_lambda(*, function_name, invocation_type = None, log_type = None, client_context = None, payload = None, qualifier = None)

      Invoke Lambda Function.

      .. seealso::
          - :external+boto3:py:meth:`Lambda.Client.invoke`

      :param function_name: AWS Lambda Function Name
      :param invocation_type: AWS Lambda Invocation Type (RequestResponse, Event etc)
      :param log_type: Tail Invocation Request
      :param client_context: Up to 3,583 bytes of base64-encoded data about the invoking client
          to pass to the function in the context object.
      :param payload: The JSON that you want to provide to your Lambda function as input.
      :param qualifier: AWS Lambda Function Version or Alias Name

      Creates a Lambda function.

      :param function_name: AWS Lambda Function Name
      :param runtime: The identifier of the function's runtime.
          Runtime is required if the deployment package is a .zip file archive.
      :param role: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function's execution role.
      :param handler: The name of the method within your code that Lambda calls to run your function.
          Handler is required if the deployment package is a .zip file archive.
      :param code: The code for the function.
      :param description: A description of the function.
      :param timeout: The amount of time (in seconds) that Lambda
          allows a function to run before stopping it.
      :param memory_size: The amount of memory available to the function at runtime.
          Increasing the function memory also increases its CPU allocation.
      :param publish: Set to true to publish the first version of the function during creation.
      :param vpc_config: For network connectivity to Amazon Web Services resources in a VPC,
          specify a list of security groups and subnets in the VPC.
      :param package_type: The type of deployment package.
          Set to `Image` for container image and set to `Zip` for .zip file archive.
      :param dead_letter_config: A dead-letter queue configuration that specifies the queue or topic
          where Lambda sends asynchronous events when they fail processing.
      :param environment: Environment variables that are accessible from function code during execution.
      :param kms_key_arn: The ARN of the Key Management Service (KMS) key that's used to
          encrypt your function's environment variables.
          If it's not provided, Lambda uses a default service key.
      :param tracing_config: Set `Mode` to `Active` to sample and trace
          a subset of incoming requests with X-Ray.
      :param tags: A list of tags to apply to the function.
      :param layers: A list of function layers to add to the function's execution environment.
          Specify each layer by its ARN, including the version.
      :param file_system_configs: Connection settings for an Amazon EFS file system.
      :param image_config: Container image configuration values that override
          the values in the container image Dockerfile.
      :param code_signing_config_arn: To enable code signing for this function,
          specify the ARN of a code-signing configuration.
          A code-signing configuration includes a set of signing profiles,
          which define the trusted publishers for this function.
      :param architectures: The instruction set architecture that the function supports.
