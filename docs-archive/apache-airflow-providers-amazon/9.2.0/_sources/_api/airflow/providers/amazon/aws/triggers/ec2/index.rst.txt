.. py:class:: EC2StateSensorTrigger(instance_id, target_state, aws_conn_id = 'aws_default', region_name = None, poll_interval = 60)


   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.triggers.base.BaseTrigger`

   Poll the EC2 instance and yield a TriggerEvent once the state of the instance matches the target_state.

   :param instance_id: id of the AWS EC2 instance
   :param target_state: target state of instance
   :param aws_conn_id: The Airflow connection used for AWS credentials.
       If this is None or empty then the default boto3 behaviour is used. If
       running Airflow in a distributed manner and aws_conn_id is None or
       empty, then default boto3 configuration would be used (and must be
       maintained on each worker node).
   :param region_name: (optional) aws region name associated with the client
   :param poll_interval: number of seconds to wait before attempting the next poll

   .. py:method:: serialize()

      Return the information needed to reconstruct this Trigger.

      :return: Tuple of (class path, keyword arguments needed to re-instantiate).


   .. py:method:: hook()


   .. py:method:: run()
      :async:

      Run the trigger in an asynchronous context.

      The trigger should yield an Event whenever it wants to fire off
      an event, and return None if it is finished. Single-event triggers
      should thus yield and then immediately return.

      If it yields, it is likely that it will be resumed very quickly,
      but it may not be (e.g. if the workload is being moved to another
      triggerer process, or a multi-event trigger was being used for a
      single-event task defer).

      In either case, Trigger classes should assume they will be persisted,
      and then rely on cleanup() being called when they are no longer needed.
