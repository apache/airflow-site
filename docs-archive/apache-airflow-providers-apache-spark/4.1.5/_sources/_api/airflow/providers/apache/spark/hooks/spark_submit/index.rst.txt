   Wrap the spark-submit binary to kick off a spark-submit job; requires "spark-submit" binary in the PATH.

   :param conf: Arbitrary Spark configuration properties
   :param spark_conn_id: The :ref:`spark connection id <howto/connection:spark>` as configured
       in Airflow administration. When an invalid connection_id is supplied, it will default
       to yarn.
   :param files: Upload additional files to the executor running the job, separated by a
       comma. Files will be placed in the working directory of each executor.
       For example, serialized objects.
   :param py_files: Additional python files used by the job, can be .zip, .egg or .py.
   :param archives: Archives that spark should unzip (and possibly tag with #ALIAS) into
       the application working directory.
   :param driver_class_path: Additional, driver-specific, classpath settings.
   :param jars: Submit additional jars to upload and place them in executor classpath.
   :param java_class: the main class of the Java application
   :param packages: Comma-separated list of maven coordinates of jars to include on the
       driver and executor classpaths
   :param exclude_packages: Comma-separated list of maven coordinates of jars to exclude
       while resolving the dependencies provided in 'packages'
   :param repositories: Comma-separated list of additional remote repositories to search
       for the maven coordinates given with 'packages'
   :param total_executor_cores: (Standalone & Mesos only) Total cores for all executors
       (Default: all the available cores on the worker)
   :param executor_cores: (Standalone, YARN and Kubernetes only) Number of cores per
       executor (Default: 2)
   :param executor_memory: Memory per executor (e.g. 1000M, 2G) (Default: 1G)
   :param driver_memory: Memory allocated to the driver (e.g. 1000M, 2G) (Default: 1G)
   :param keytab: Full path to the file that contains the keytab
   :param principal: The name of the kerberos principal used for keytab
   :param proxy_user: User to impersonate when submitting the application
   :param name: Name of the job (default airflow-spark)
   :param num_executors: Number of executors to launch
   :param status_poll_interval: Seconds to wait between polls of driver status in cluster
       mode (Default: 1)
   :param application_args: Arguments for the application being submitted
   :param env_vars: Environment variables for spark-submit. It
       supports yarn and k8s mode too.
   :param verbose: Whether to pass the verbose flag to spark-submit process for debugging
   :param spark_binary: The command to use for spark submit.
                        Some distros may use spark2-submit or spark3-submit.
