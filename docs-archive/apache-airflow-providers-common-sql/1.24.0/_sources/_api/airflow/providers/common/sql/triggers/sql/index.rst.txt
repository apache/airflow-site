Module Contents

.. py:class:: SQLExecuteQueryTrigger(sql, conn_id, hook_params = None, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.triggers.base.BaseTrigger`


   A trigger that executes SQL code in async mode.

   :param sql: the sql statement to be executed (str) or a list of sql statements to execute
   :param conn_id: the connection ID used to connect to the database
   :param hook_params: hook parameters


   .. py:attribute:: sql


   .. py:attribute:: conn_id


   .. py:attribute:: hook_params
      :value: None



   .. py:method:: serialize()

      Serialize the SQLExecuteQueryTrigger arguments and classpath.



   .. py:method:: run()
      :async:


      Run the trigger in an asynchronous context.

      The trigger should yield an Event whenever it wants to fire off
      an event, and return None if it is finished. Single-event triggers
      should thus yield and then immediately return.

      If it yields, it is likely that it will be resumed very quickly,
      but it may not be (e.g. if the workload is being moved to another
      triggerer process, or a multi-event trigger was being used for a
      single-event task defer).

      In either case, Trigger classes should assume they will be persisted,
      and then rely on cleanup() being called when they are no longer needed.
