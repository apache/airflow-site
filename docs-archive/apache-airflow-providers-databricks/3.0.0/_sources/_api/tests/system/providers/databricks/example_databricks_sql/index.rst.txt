.. py:module:: tests.system.providers.databricks.example_databricks_sql

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   This is an example DAG which uses the DatabricksSubmitRunOperator.
   In this example, we create two tasks which execute sequentially.
   The first task is to run a notebook at the workspace path "/test"
   and the second task is to run a JAR uploaded to DBFS. Both,
   tasks use new clusters.

   Because we have set a downstream dependency on the notebook task,
   the spark jar task will NOT run until the notebook task completes
   successfully.

   The definition of a successful run is if the run has a result_state of "SUCCESS".
   For more information about the state of a run refer to
   https://docs.databricks.com/api/latest/jobs.html#runstate
