.. py:class:: DbtCloudRunJobOperatorLink

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.models.BaseOperatorLink`

   Operator link for DbtCloudRunJobOperator. This link allows users to monitor the triggered job run
   directly in dbt Cloud.

   .. py:attribute:: name
      :value: 'Monitor Job Run'

      

   .. py:method:: get_link(operator, *, ti_key=None)

      Link to external system.

      Note: The old signature of this function was ``(self, operator, dttm: datetime)``. That is still
      supported at runtime but is deprecated.

      :param operator: The Airflow operator object this link is associated to.
      :param ti_key: TaskInstance ID to return link for.
      :return: link to external system

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.models.BaseOperator`

   Executes a dbt Cloud job.

   .. seealso::
       For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
       :ref:`howto/operator:DbtCloudRunJobOperator`

   :param dbt_cloud_conn_id: The connection ID for connecting to dbt Cloud.
   :param job_id: The ID of a dbt Cloud job.
   :param account_id: Optional. The ID of a dbt Cloud account.
   :param trigger_reason: Optional. Description of the reason to trigger the job.
       Defaults to "Triggered via Apache Airflow by task <task_id> in the <dag_id> DAG."
   :param steps_override: Optional. List of dbt commands to execute when triggering the job instead of those
       configured in dbt Cloud.
   :param schema_override: Optional. Override the destination schema in the configured target for this job.
   :param wait_for_termination: Flag to wait on a job run's termination.  By default, this feature is
       enabled but could be disabled to perform an asynchronous wait for a long-running job run execution
       using the ``DbtCloudJobRunSensor``.
   :param timeout: Time in seconds to wait for a job run to reach a terminal status for non-asynchronous
       waits. Used only if ``wait_for_termination`` is True. Defaults to 7 days.
   :param check_interval: Time in seconds to check on a job run's status for non-asynchronous waits.
       Used only if ``wait_for_termination`` is True. Defaults to 60 seconds.
   :param additional_run_config: Optional. Any additional parameters that should be included in the API
       request when triggering the job.
   :param deferrable: Run operator in the deferrable mode
   :return: The ID of the triggered dbt Cloud job run.

   .. py:attribute:: operator_extra_links
      :value: ()

      

   .. py:method:: execute(context)

      This is the main method to derive when creating an operator.
      Context is the same dictionary used as when rendering jinja templates.

      Refer to get_template_context for more context.


   .. py:method:: execute_complete(context, event)

      Callback for when the trigger fires - returns immediately.
      Relies on trigger to throw an exception, otherwise it assumes execution was
      successful.


   .. py:method:: on_kill()

      Override this method to clean up subprocesses when a task instance
      gets killed. Any use of the threading, subprocess or multiprocessing
      module within an operator needs to be cleaned up, or it will leave
      ghost processes behind.



.. py:class:: DbtCloudGetJobRunArtifactOperator(*, dbt_cloud_conn_id = DbtCloudHook.default_conn_name, run_id, path, account_id = None, step = None, output_file_name = None, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.models.BaseOperator`

   Download artifacts from a dbt Cloud job run.

   .. seealso::
       For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
       :ref:`howto/operator:DbtCloudGetJobRunArtifactOperator`

   :param dbt_cloud_conn_id: The connection ID for connecting to dbt Cloud.
   :param run_id: The ID of a dbt Cloud job run.
   :param path: The file path related to the artifact file. Paths are rooted at the target/ directory.
       Use "manifest.json", "catalog.json", or "run_results.json" to download dbt-generated artifacts
       for the run.
   :param account_id: Optional. The ID of a dbt Cloud account.
   :param step: Optional. The index of the Step in the Run to query for artifacts. The first step in the
       run has the index 1. If the step parameter is omitted, artifacts for the last step in the run will
       be returned.
   :param output_file_name: Optional. The desired file name for the download artifact file.
       Defaults to <run_id>_<path> (e.g. "728368_run_results.json").

   .. py:attribute:: template_fields
      :value: ('dbt_cloud_conn_id', 'run_id', 'path', 'account_id', 'output_file_name')

.. py:class:: DbtCloudListJobsOperator(*, dbt_cloud_conn_id = DbtCloudHook.default_conn_name, account_id = None, project_id = None, order_by = None, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.models.BaseOperator`

   List jobs in a dbt Cloud project.

   .. seealso::
       For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
       :ref:`howto/operator:DbtCloudListJobsOperator`

   Retrieves metadata for all jobs tied to a specified dbt Cloud account. If a ``project_id`` is
   supplied, only jobs pertaining to this project id will be retrieved.

   :param account_id: Optional. If an account ID is not provided explicitly,
       the account ID from the dbt Cloud connection will be used.
   :param order_by: Optional. Field to order the result by. Use '-' to indicate reverse order.
       For example, to use reverse order by the run ID use ``order_by=-id``.
   :param project_id: Optional. The ID of a dbt Cloud project.

   .. py:attribute:: template_fields
      :value: ('account_id', 'project_id')
