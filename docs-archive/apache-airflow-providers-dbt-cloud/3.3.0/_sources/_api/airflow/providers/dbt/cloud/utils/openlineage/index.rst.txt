.. py:function:: generate_openlineage_events_from_dbt_cloud_run(operator, task_instance)

   Common method generating OpenLineage events from the DBT Cloud run.

   This function retrieves information about a DBT Cloud run, including the associated job,
   project, and execution details. It processes the run's artifacts, such as the manifest and run results,
   in parallel for many steps.
   Then it generates and emits OpenLineage events based on the executed DBT tasks.

   :param operator: Instance of DBT Cloud operator that executed DBT tasks.
       It already should have run_id and dbt cloud hook.
   :param task_instance: Currently executed task instance

   :return: An empty OperatorLineage object indicating the completion of events generation.
