.. py:class:: CloudAutoMLHook(gcp_conn_id = 'google_cloud_default', impersonation_chain = None, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.google.common.hooks.base_google.GoogleBaseHook`

   Google Cloud AutoML hook.

   All the methods in the hook where project_id is used must be called with
   keyword arguments rather than positional.

   .. py:method:: extract_object_id(obj)
      :staticmethod:

      Returns unique id of the object.


   .. py:method:: get_conn()

      Retrieves connection to AutoML.

      :return: Google Cloud AutoML client object.


   .. py:method:: prediction_client()

      Creates PredictionServiceClient.

      :return: Google Cloud AutoML PredictionServiceClient client object.

      Creates a model_id. Returns a Model in the `response` field when it
      completes. When you create a model, several model evaluations are
      created for it: a global evaluation, and one evaluation for each
      annotation spec.

      :param model: The model_id to create. If a dict is provided, it must be of the same form
          as the protobuf message `google.cloud.automl_v1beta1.types.Model`

          Note that if `retry` is specified, the timeout applies to each individual attempt.
      :param metadata: Additional metadata that is provided to the method.

      :return: `google.cloud.automl_v1beta1.types._OperationFuture` instance
