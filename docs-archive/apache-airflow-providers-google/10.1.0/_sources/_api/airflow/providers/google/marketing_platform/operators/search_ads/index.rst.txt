.. py:class:: GoogleSearchAdsInsertReportOperator(*, report, api_version = 'v2', gcp_conn_id = 'google_cloud_default', delegate_to = None, impersonation_chain = None, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.models.BaseOperator`

   Inserts a report request into the reporting system.

       For API documentation check:
       https://developers.google.com/search-ads/v2/reference/reports/request

   .. seealso::
       For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
       :ref:`howto/operator:GoogleSearchAdsInsertReportOperator`

   :param report: Report to be generated
   :param api_version: The version of the api that will be requested for example 'v3'.
   :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use when fetching connection info.
   :param delegate_to: The account to impersonate using domain-wide delegation of authority,
       if any. For this to work, the service account making the request must have
       domain-wide delegation enabled.
   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
       of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).

   .. py:attribute:: template_fields
      :type: Sequence[str]
      :value: ('report', 'impersonation_chain')

      

   .. py:attribute:: template_ext
      :type: Sequence[str]
      :value: ('.json',)

      

   .. py:method:: prepare_template()

      Hook triggered after the templated fields get replaced by their content.

      If you need your object to alter the content of the file before the
      template is rendered, it should override this method to do so.


   .. py:method:: execute(context)

      This is the main method to derive when creating an operator.
      Context is the same dictionary used as when rendering jinja templates.

      Refer to get_template_context for more context.



.. py:class:: GoogleSearchAdsDownloadReportOperator(*, report_id, bucket_name, report_name = None, gzip = True, chunk_size = 10 * 1024 * 1024, api_version = 'v2', gcp_conn_id = 'google_cloud_default', delegate_to = None, impersonation_chain = None, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.models.BaseOperator`

   :param report_id: ID of the report.
   :param bucket_name: The bucket to upload to.
   :param report_name: The report name to set when uploading the local file. If not provided then
       report_id is used.
   :param gzip: Option to compress local file or file data for upload
   :param api_version: The version of the api that will be requested for example 'v3'.
   :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use when fetching connection info.
