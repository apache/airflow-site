   .. py:method:: create_pipeline_job(project_id, region, pipeline_job, pipeline_job_id, retry = DEFAULT, timeout = None, metadata = ())

      Create a PipelineJob. A PipelineJob will run immediately when created.

      :param project_id: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud project that the service belongs to.
      :param region: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud region that the service belongs to.
      :param pipeline_job:  Required. The PipelineJob to create.
      :param pipeline_job_id:  The ID to use for the PipelineJob, which will become the final component of
          the PipelineJob name. If not provided, an ID will be automatically generated.

          This value should be less than 128 characters, and valid characters are /[a-z][0-9]-/.
      :param retry: Designation of what errors, if any, should be retried.
      :param timeout: The timeout for this request.
      :param metadata: Strings which should be sent along with the request as metadata.


   .. py:method:: run_pipeline_job(project_id, region, display_name, template_path, job_id = None, pipeline_root = None, parameter_values = None, input_artifacts = None, enable_caching = None, encryption_spec_key_name = None, labels = None, failure_policy = None, service_account = None, network = None, create_request_timeout = None, experiment = None)

      Run PipelineJob and monitor the job until completion.

      :param project_id: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud project that the service belongs to.
      :param region: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud region that the service belongs to.
      :param display_name: Required. The user-defined name of this Pipeline.
      :param template_path: Required. The path of PipelineJob or PipelineSpec JSON or YAML file. It can be
          a local path, a Google Cloud Storage URI (e.g. "gs://project.name"), an Artifact Registry URI
          (e.g. "https://us-central1-kfp.pkg.dev/proj/repo/pack/latest"), or an HTTPS URI.
      :param job_id: Optional. The unique ID of the job run. If not specified, pipeline name + timestamp
          will be used.
      :param pipeline_root: Optional. The root of the pipeline outputs. If not set, the staging bucket set
          in aiplatform.init will be used. If that's not set a pipeline-specific artifacts bucket will be
          used.
      :param parameter_values: Optional. The mapping from runtime parameter names to its values that
          control the pipeline run.
      :param input_artifacts: Optional. The mapping from the runtime parameter name for this artifact to
          its resource id. For example: "vertex_model":"456". Note: full resource name
          ("projects/123/locations/us-central1/metadataStores/default/artifacts/456") cannot be used.
      :param enable_caching: Optional. Whether to turn on caching for the run.
          If this is not set, defaults to the compile time settings, which are True for all tasks by
          default, while users may specify different caching options for individual tasks.
          If this is set, the setting applies to all tasks in the pipeline. Overrides the compile time
          settings.
      :param encryption_spec_key_name: Optional. The Cloud KMS resource identifier of the customer managed
          encryption key used to protect the job. Has the form:
          ``projects/my-project/locations/my-region/keyRings/my-kr/cryptoKeys/my-key``.
          The key needs to be in the same region as where the compute resource is created. If this is set,
          then all resources created by the PipelineJob will be encrypted with the provided encryption key.
          Overrides encryption_spec_key_name set in aiplatform.init.
      :param labels: Optional. The user defined metadata to organize PipelineJob.
      :param failure_policy: Optional. The failure policy - "slow" or "fast". Currently, the default of a
          pipeline is that the pipeline will continue to run until no more tasks can be executed, also
          known as PIPELINE_FAILURE_POLICY_FAIL_SLOW (corresponds to "slow"). However, if a pipeline is set
          to PIPELINE_FAILURE_POLICY_FAIL_FAST (corresponds to "fast"), it will stop scheduling any new
          tasks when a task has failed. Any scheduled tasks will continue to completion.
      :param service_account: Optional. Specifies the service account for workload run-as account. Users
          submitting jobs must have act-as permission on this run-as account.
      :param network: Optional. The full name of the Compute Engine network to which the job should be
          peered. For example, projects/12345/global/networks/myVPC.
          Private services access must already be configured for the network. If left unspecified, the
          network set in aiplatform.init will be used. Otherwise, the job is not peered with any network.
      :param create_request_timeout: Optional. The timeout for the create request in seconds.
      :param experiment: Optional. The Vertex AI experiment name or instance to associate to this
          PipelineJob. Metrics produced by the PipelineJob as system.Metric Artifacts will be associated as
          metrics to the current Experiment Run. Pipeline parameters will be associated as parameters to
          the current Experiment Run.

          -  ``display_name``: Supports ``=``, ``!=`` comparisons, and
             ``:`` wildcard.
          -  ``pipeline_job_user_id``: Supports ``=``, ``!=``
             comparisons, and ``:`` wildcard. for example, can check
             if pipeline's display_name contains *step* by doing
             display_name:"*step*"
          -  ``create_time``: Supports ``=``, ``!=``, ``<``, ``>``,

             3339 format.
          -  ``labels``: Supports key-value equality and key presence.

          Filter expressions can be combined together using logical
          operators (``AND`` & ``OR``). For example:
          ``pipeline_name="test" AND create_time>"2020-05-18T13:30:00Z"``.

          The syntax to define filter expression is based on

          [PipelineService.ListPipelineJobs][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.PipelineService.ListPipelineJobs]
          call.
      :param order_by: Optional. A comma-separated list of fields to order by. The default
          sort order is in ascending order. Use "desc" after a field

          provided e.g. "create_time desc, end_time", "end_time,
          start_time, update_time" For example, using "create_time
          desc, end_time" will order results by create time in
          descending order, and if there are multiple jobs having the
          same create time, order them by the end time in ascending
          order. if order_by is not specified, it will order by
          default order is create time in descending order. Supported
          fields:
