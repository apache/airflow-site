   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.cloud_base.GoogleCloudBaseOperator`

   Creates a new bucket.

   Google Cloud Storage uses a flat namespace, so you
   can't create a bucket with a name that is already in use.

       .. seealso::
           For more information, see Bucket Naming Guidelines:
           https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/bucketnaming.html#requirements

   :param bucket_name: The name of the bucket. (templated)
   :param resource: An optional dict with parameters for creating the bucket.
           For information on available parameters, see Cloud Storage API doc:
           https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/buckets/insert
   :param storage_class: This defines how objects in the bucket are stored
           and determines the SLA and the cost of storage (templated). Values include

           - ``MULTI_REGIONAL``
           - ``REGIONAL``
           - ``STANDARD``
           - ``NEARLINE``
           - ``COLDLINE``.

           If this value is not specified when the bucket is
           created, it will default to STANDARD.
   :param location: The location of the bucket. (templated)
       Object data for objects in the bucket resides in physical storage
       within this region. Defaults to US.

       .. seealso:: https://developers.google.com/storage/docs/bucket-locations

   :param project_id: The ID of the Google Cloud Project. (templated)
   :param labels: User-provided labels, in key/value pairs.
   :param gcp_conn_id: (Optional) The connection ID used to connect to Google Cloud.
   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
       of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).

   The following Operator would create a new bucket ``test-bucket``
   with ``MULTI_REGIONAL`` storage class in ``EU`` region

   .. code-block:: python

       CreateBucket = GCSCreateBucketOperator(
           task_id="CreateNewBucket",

   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token

   :param match_glob: (Optional) filters objects based on the glob pattern given by the string
       (e.g, ``'**/*/.json'``)
