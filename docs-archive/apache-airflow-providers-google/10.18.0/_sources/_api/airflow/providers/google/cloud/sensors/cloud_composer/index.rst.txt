.. py:class:: CloudComposerEnvironmentSensor(*, project_id, region, operation_name, gcp_conn_id = 'google_cloud_default', impersonation_chain = None, pooling_period_seconds = 30, **kwargs)


   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.sensors.base.BaseSensorOperator`

   Check the status of the Cloud Composer Environment task.

   This Sensor is deprecated. You can achieve the same functionality by using Cloud Composer Operators
   CloudComposerCreateEnvironmentOperator, CloudComposerDeleteEnvironmentOperator and
   CloudComposerUpdateEnvironmentOperator in  deferrable or non-deferrable mode, since every operator
   gives user a possibility to wait (asynchronously or synchronously) until Operation will be finished.

   :param project_id: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud project that the service belongs to.
   :param region: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud region that the service belongs to.
   :param operation_name: The name of the operation resource
   :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use when fetching connection info.
   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
       of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).
   :param pooling_period_seconds: Optional: Control the rate of the poll for the result of deferrable run.

   .. py:method:: execute(context)

      Airflow runs this method on the worker and defers using the trigger.


   .. py:method:: execute_complete(context, event = None)

      Act as a callback for when the trigger fires - returns immediately.

      Relies on trigger to throw an exception, otherwise it assumes execution was successful.
