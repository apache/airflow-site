.. py:class:: MLEngineHook(**kwargs)


   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.google.common.hooks.base_google.GoogleBaseHook`

   Hook for Google ML Engine APIs.

   All the methods in the hook where project_id is used must be called with
   keyword arguments rather than positional.

   .. py:method:: get_conn()

      Retrieve the connection to MLEngine.

      :return: Google MLEngine services object.


   .. py:method:: create_job(job, project_id, use_existing_job_fn = None)

      Launch a MLEngine job and wait for it to reach a terminal state.

      :param project_id: The Google Cloud project id within which MLEngine
          job will be launched. If set to None or missing, the default project_id from the Google Cloud
          connection is used.
      :param job: MLEngine Job object that should be provided to the MLEngine
          API, such as: ::

              {
                'jobId': 'my_job_id',
                'trainingInput': {
                  'scaleTier': 'STANDARD_1',
                  ...
                }
              }

      :param use_existing_job_fn: In case that a MLEngine job with the same
          job_id already exist, this method (if provided) will decide whether
          we should use this existing job, continue waiting for it to finish
          and returning the job object. It should accepts a MLEngine job
          object, and returns a boolean value indicating whether it is OK to
          reuse the existing job. If 'use_existing_job_fn' is not provided,
          we by default reuse the existing MLEngine job.
      :return: The MLEngine job object if the job successfully reach a
          terminal state (which might be FAILED or CANCELLED state).


   .. py:method:: create_job_without_waiting_result(body, project_id)

      Launch a MLEngine job and wait for it to reach a terminal state.

      :param project_id: The Google Cloud project id within which MLEngine
          job will be launched. If set to None or missing, the default project_id from the Google Cloud
          connection is used.
      :param body: MLEngine Job object that should be provided to the MLEngine
          API, such as: ::

              {
                'jobId': 'my_job_id',
                'trainingInput': {
                  'scaleTier': 'STANDARD_1',
                  ...
                }
              }
      :return: The MLEngine job_id of the object if the job successfully reach a
          terminal state (which might be FAILED or CANCELLED state).


   .. py:method:: cancel_job(job_id, project_id)

      Cancel a MLEngine job.

      :param project_id: The Google Cloud project id within which MLEngine
          job will be cancelled. If set to None or missing, the default project_id from the Google Cloud
          connection is used.
      :param job_id: A unique id for the want-to-be cancelled Google MLEngine training job.
