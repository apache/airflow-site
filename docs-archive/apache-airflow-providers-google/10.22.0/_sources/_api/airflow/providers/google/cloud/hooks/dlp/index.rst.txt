.. py:class:: CloudDLPHook(gcp_conn_id = 'google_cloud_default', impersonation_chain = None, **kwargs)


   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.google.common.hooks.base_google.GoogleBaseHook`

   Hook for Google Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP) APIs.

   Cloud DLP allows clients to detect the presence of Personally Identifiable
   Information (PII) and other privacy-sensitive data in user-supplied,
   unstructured data streams, like text blocks or images. The service also
   includes methods for sensitive data redaction and scheduling of data scans
   on Google Cloud based data sets.

   :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use when fetching connection info.
   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
       of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account.

   .. py:method:: get_conn()

      Provide a client for interacting with the Cloud DLP API.
