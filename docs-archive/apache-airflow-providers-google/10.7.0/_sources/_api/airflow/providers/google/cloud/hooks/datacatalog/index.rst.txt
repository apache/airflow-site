          streaming is performed per-page, this determines the maximum number of resources in a page.
      :param order_by: Specifies the ordering of results, currently supported case-sensitive choices are:

          If not specified, defaults to ``relevance`` descending.

          retried using a default configuration.

      :param project_id: The ID of the Google Cloud project that owns the entry group.
          If set to ``None`` or missing, the default project_id from the Google Cloud connection is used.
      :param retry: A retry object used to retry requests. If ``None`` is specified, requests will be
          retried using a default configuration.
      :param timeout: The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the request to complete. Note that if
          ``retry`` is specified, the timeout applies to each individual attempt.

   .. py:method:: update_tag_template(tag_template, update_mask, project_id, location = None, tag_template_id = None, retry = DEFAULT, timeout = None, metadata = ())

      Updates a tag template.

      This method cannot be used to update the fields of a template. The tag
      template fields are represented as separate resources and should be updated using their own
      create/update/delete methods.

      :param tag_template: Required. The template to update. The "name" field must be set.

          If a dict is provided, it must be of the same form as the protobuf message
          :class:`~google.cloud.datacatalog_v1beta1.types.TagTemplate`
      :param update_mask: The field mask specifies the parts of the template to overwrite.

          If absent or empty, all of the allowed fields above will be updated.

          If a dict is provided, it must be of the same form as the protobuf message
          :class:`~google.protobuf.field_mask_pb2.FieldMask`
      :param location: Required. The location of the tag template to rename.
      :param tag_template_id: Optional. The tag template ID for the entry that is being updated.
      :param project_id: The ID of the Google Cloud project that owns the entry group.
          If set to ``None`` or missing, the default project_id from the Google Cloud connection is used.
      :param retry: A retry object used to retry requests. If ``None`` is specified, requests will be
          retried using a default configuration.
      :param timeout: The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the request to complete. Note that if

   .. py:method:: update_tag_template_field(tag_template_field, update_mask, project_id, tag_template_field_name = None, location = None, tag_template = None, tag_template_field_id = None, retry = DEFAULT, timeout = None, metadata = ())

      Updates a field in a tag template. This method cannot be used to update the field type.

      :param tag_template_field: Required. The template to update.

          If a dict is provided, it must be of the same form as the protobuf message
          :class:`~google.cloud.datacatalog_v1beta1.types.TagTemplateField`
      :param update_mask: The field mask specifies the parts of the template to be updated. Allowed fields:

          -  ``display_name``
          -  ``type.enum_type``

          If ``update_mask`` is not set or empty, all of the allowed fields above will be updated.

          When updating an enum type, the provided values will be merged with the existing values.
          Therefore, enum values can only be added, existing enum values cannot be deleted nor renamed.

          If a dict is provided, it must be of the same form as the protobuf message
          :class:`~google.protobuf.field_mask_pb2.FieldMask`
      :param tag_template_field_name: Optional. The name of the tag template field to rename.
      :param location: Optional. The location of the tag to rename.
      :param tag_template: Optional. The tag template ID for tag template field to rename.
      :param tag_template_field_id: Optional. The ID of tag template field to rename.
      :param project_id: The ID of the Google Cloud project that owns the entry group.
