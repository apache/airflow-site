   Downloads and runs cloud-sql-proxy as subprocess of the Python process.

   The cloud-sql-proxy needs to be downloaded and started before we can connect
   to the Google Cloud SQL instance via database connection. It establishes
   secure tunnel connection to the database. It authorizes using the
   Google Cloud credentials that are passed by the configuration.

   More details about the proxy can be found here:

       directories created for unix sockets.
   :param instance_specification: Specification of the instance to connect the
       proxy to. It should be specified in the form that is described in
       https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/sql-proxy#multiple-instances in
       -instances parameter (typically in the form of ``<project>:<region>:<instance>``
       for UNIX socket connections and in the form of
       ``<project>:<region>:<instance>=tcp:<port>`` for TCP connections.
   :param gcp_conn_id: Id of Google Cloud connection to use for

       (for example 'v1.13'). By default latest version is downloaded.
   :param sql_proxy_binary_path: If specified, then proxy will be
       used from the path specified rather than dynamically generated. This means
       that if the binary is not present in that path it will also be downloaded.

.. py:class:: CloudSQLDatabaseHook(gcp_cloudsql_conn_id = 'google_cloud_sql_default', gcp_conn_id = 'google_cloud_default', default_gcp_project_id = None, sql_proxy_binary_path = None)


   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.hooks.base.BaseHook`

   Serves DB connection configuration for Google Cloud SQL (Connections of *gcpcloudsqldb://* type).

   The hook is a "meta" one. It does not perform an actual connection.

   It is there to retrieve all the parameters configured in gcpcloudsql:// connection,
   start/stop Cloud SQL Proxy if needed, dynamically generate Postgres or MySQL
   connection in the database and return an actual Postgres or MySQL hook.
   The returned Postgres/MySQL hooks are using direct connection or Cloud SQL
   Proxy socket/TCP as configured.

   Main parameters of the hook are retrieved from the standard URI components:

   * **user** - User name to authenticate to the database (from login of the URI).
   * **password** - Password to authenticate to the database (from password of the URI).
   * **public_ip** - IP to connect to for public connection (from host of the URI).
   * **public_port** - Port to connect to for public connection (from port of the URI).
   * **database** - Database to connect to (from schema of the URI).
   * **sql_proxy_binary_path** - Optional path to Cloud SQL Proxy binary. If the binary
     is not specified or the binary is not present, it is automatically downloaded.

   Remaining parameters are retrieved from the extras (URI query parameters):

   * **project_id** - Optional, Google Cloud project where the Cloud SQL
      instance exists. If missing, default project id passed is used.
   * **instance** -  Name of the instance of the Cloud SQL database instance.
   * **location** - The location of the Cloud SQL instance (for example europe-west1).
   * **database_type** - The type of the database instance (MySQL or Postgres).
   * **use_proxy** - (default False) Whether SQL proxy should be used to connect to Cloud
     SQL DB.
   * **use_ssl** - (default False) Whether SSL should be used to connect to Cloud SQL DB.
     You cannot use proxy and SSL together.
   * **sql_proxy_use_tcp** - (default False) If set to true, TCP is used to connect via
     proxy, otherwise UNIX sockets are used.
   * **sql_proxy_version** -  Specific version of the proxy to download (for example
     v1.13). If not specified, the latest version is downloaded.
   * **sslcert** - Path to client certificate to authenticate when SSL is used.
   * **sslkey** - Path to client private key to authenticate when SSL is used.
   * **sslrootcert** - Path to server's certificate to authenticate when SSL is used.

   :param gcp_cloudsql_conn_id: URL of the connection
   :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID used to connect to Google Cloud for
       cloud-sql-proxy authentication.
   :param default_gcp_project_id: Default project id used if project_id not specified
          in the connection URL

   .. py:method:: create_connection()

      Create a connection.

      Connection ID will be randomly generated according to whether it uses
      proxy, TCP, UNIX sockets, SSL.


   .. py:method:: get_sqlproxy_runner()

      Retrieve Cloud SQL Proxy runner.

      It is used to manage the proxy lifecycle per task.

      :return: The Cloud SQL Proxy runner.


   .. py:method:: get_database_hook(connection)

      Retrieve database hook.

      This is the actual Postgres or MySQL database hook that uses proxy or
      connects directly to the Google Cloud SQL database.


   .. py:method:: cleanup_database_hook()

      Clean up database hook after it was used.


   .. py:method:: reserve_free_tcp_port()
