.. py:exception:: WaitOperationNotDoneYetError


   Bases: :py:obj:`Exception`

   Wait operation not done yet error.


.. py:class:: CloudTranslateHook(gcp_conn_id = 'google_cloud_default', impersonation_chain = None, **kwargs)


   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.google.common.hooks.base_google.GoogleBaseHook`

   Hook for Google Cloud translate APIs.

   All the methods in the hook where project_id is used must be called with
   keyword arguments rather than positional.

   .. py:method:: get_conn()

      Retrieve connection to Cloud Translate.

      :return: Google Cloud Translate client object.


   .. py:method:: translate(values, target_language, format_ = None, source_language = None, model = None)

      Translate a string or list of strings.

      See https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/translating-text

      :param values: String or list of strings to translate.
      :param target_language: The language to translate results into. This
                              is required by the API and defaults to
                              the target language of the current instance.
      :param format_: (Optional) One of ``text`` or ``html``, to specify
                      if the input text is plain text or HTML.
      :param source_language: (Optional) The language of the text to
                              be translated.
      :param model: (Optional) The model used to translate the text, such
                    as ``'base'`` or ``'NMT'``.
      :returns: A list of dictionaries for each queried value. Each
                dictionary typically contains three keys (though not
                all will be present in all cases)

                * ``detectedSourceLanguage``: The detected language (as an
                  ISO 639-1 language code) of the text.

                * ``translatedText``: The translation of the text into the
                  target language.

                * ``input``: The corresponding input value.

                * ``model``: The model used to translate the text.

                If only a single value is passed, then only a single
                dictionary will be returned.
      :raises: :class:`~exceptions.ValueError` if the number of
               values and translations differ.



.. py:class:: TranslateHook(gcp_conn_id = 'google_cloud_default', impersonation_chain = None, **kwargs)


   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.google.common.hooks.base_google.GoogleBaseHook`

   Hook for Google Cloud translation (Advanced) using client version V3.

   See related docs https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/editions#advanced.

   .. py:method:: get_client()

      Retrieve TranslationService client.

      :return: Google Cloud Translation Service client object.


   .. py:method:: wait_for_operation_done(*, operation, timeout = None, initial = 3, multiplier = 2, maximum = 3600)
      :staticmethod:

      Wait for long-running operation to be done.

      Calls operation.done() until success or timeout exhaustion, following the back-off retry strategy.
      See `google.api_core.retry.Retry`.
      It's intended use on `Operation` instances that have empty result
      (:class `google.protobuf.empty_pb2.Empty`) by design.
      Thus calling operation.result() for such operation triggers the exception
      ``GoogleAPICallError("Unexpected state: Long-running operation had neither response nor error set.")``
      even though operation itself is totally fine.


   .. py:method:: wait_for_operation_result(operation, timeout = None)
      :staticmethod:

      Wait for long-lasting operation to complete.


   .. py:method:: extract_object_id(obj)

          the source language within the response.
      :param target_language_code: Required. The ISO-639 language code to use
          for translation of the input text

          For global (no region) requests, use ``location-id`` ``global``.

      :param models: Optional. The models to use for translation. Map's key is
          target language code. Map's value is the model name. Value
          can be a built-in general model, or an AutoML Translation model.
          The value format depends on model type:

          -  AutoML Translation models:
             ``projects/{project-number-or-id}/locations/{location-id}/models/{model-id}``
          -  General (built-in) models:
             ``projects/{project-number-or-id}/locations/{location-id}/models/general/nmt``,

          If the map is empty or a specific model is not requested for
          a language pair, then default google model (NMT) is used.
      :param glossaries: Glossaries to be applied. It's keyed by target language code.
      :param retry: Designation of what errors, if any, should be retried.
      :param timeout: The timeout for this request.
      :param metadata: Strings which should be sent along with the request as metadata.

      :return: Batch translate document result from the API response.
