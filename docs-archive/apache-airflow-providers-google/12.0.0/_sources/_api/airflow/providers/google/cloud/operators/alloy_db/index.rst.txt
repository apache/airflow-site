.. py:class:: AlloyDBBaseOperator(project_id, location, gcp_conn_id = 'google_cloud_default', retry = DEFAULT, timeout = None, metadata = (), impersonation_chain = None, *args, **kwargs)


   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.cloud_base.GoogleCloudBaseOperator`

   Base class for all AlloyDB operators.

   :param project_id: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud project where the service is used.
   :param location: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud region where the service is used.
   :param gcp_conn_id: Optional. The connection ID to use to connect to Google Cloud.
   :param retry: Optional. A retry object used to retry requests. If `None` is specified, requests will not
       be retried.
   :param timeout: Optional. The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the request to complete.
       Note that if `retry` is specified, the timeout applies to each individual attempt.
   :param metadata: Optional. Additional metadata that is provided to the method.
   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
       of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).

.. py:class:: AlloyDBWriteBaseOperator(request_id = None, validate_request = False, *args, **kwargs)


   Bases: :py:obj:`AlloyDBBaseOperator`

   Base class for writing AlloyDB operators.

   These operators perform create, update or delete operations. with the objects (not inside of database).

   :param request_id: Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID
       so that if you must retry your request, the server ignores the request if it has already been
       completed. The server guarantees that for at least 60 minutes since the first request.
       For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out.
       If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if the original operation
       with the same request ID was received, and if so, ignores the second request.
       This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.
       The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
       (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
   :param validate_request: Optional. If set, performs request validation, but does not actually
       execute the request.

   .. py:attribute:: template_fields
      :type: collections.abc.Sequence[str]

      

   .. py:method:: get_operation_result(operation)

      Retrieve operation result as a proto.Message.

      If the `validate_request` parameter is set, then no operation is performed and thus nothing to wait.



.. py:class:: AlloyDBCreateClusterOperator(cluster_id, cluster_configuration, is_secondary = False, *args, **kwargs)


   Bases: :py:obj:`AlloyDBWriteBaseOperator`
