.. py:class:: ManagedKafkaBaseOperator(project_id, location, retry = DEFAULT, timeout = None, metadata = (), gcp_conn_id = 'google_cloud_default', impersonation_chain = None, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.cloud_base.GoogleCloudBaseOperator`


   Base class for Managed Kafka operators.

   :param project_id: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud project that the service belongs to.
   :param location: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud region that the service belongs to.
   :param retry: Designation of what errors, if any, should be retried.
   :param timeout: The timeout for this request.
   :param metadata: Strings which should be sent along with the request as metadata.
   :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use connecting to Google Cloud.
   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
       of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).

.. py:class:: ManagedKafkaCreateClusterOperator(cluster, cluster_id, request_id = None, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`ManagedKafkaBaseOperator`


   Create a new Apache Kafka cluster.

   :param project_id: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud project that the service belongs to.
   :param location: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud region that the service belongs to.
   :param cluster: Required. Configuration of the cluster to create. Its ``name`` field is ignored.
   :param cluster_id: Required. The ID to use for the cluster, which will become the final component of
       the cluster's name. The ID must be 1-63 characters long, and match the regular expression
       ``[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`` to comply with RFC 1035. This value is structured like: ``my-cluster-id``.
   :param request_id: Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID
       to avoid duplication of requests. If a request times out or fails, retrying with the same ID
       allows the server to recognize the previous attempt. For at least 60 minutes, the server ignores
       duplicate requests bearing the same ID. For example, consider a situation where you make an
       initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID
       within 60 minutes of the last request, the server checks if an original operation with the same
       request ID was received. If so, the server ignores the second request. The request ID must be a
       valid UUID. A zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
   :param retry: Designation of what errors, if any, should be retried.
   :param timeout: The timeout for this request.
   :param metadata: Strings which should be sent along with the request as metadata.
   :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use connecting to Google Cloud.
   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
       of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).

       of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).
