.. py:class:: BigQueryCheckOperator(*, sql, gcp_conn_id = 'google_cloud_default', use_legacy_sql = True, location = None, impersonation_chain = None, labels = None, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`_BigQueryDbHookMixin`, :py:obj:`airflow.operators.sql.SQLCheckOperator`

   Performs checks against BigQuery. The ``BigQueryCheckOperator`` expects
   a sql query that will return a single row. Each value on that
   first row is evaluated using python ``bool`` casting. If any of the
   values return ``False`` the check is failed and errors out.

   .. seealso::
       For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
       :ref:`howto/operator:BigQueryCheckOperator`

   Note that Python bool casting evals the following as ``False``:

   * ``False``
   * ``0``
   * Empty string (``""``)
   * Empty list (``[]``)
   * Empty dictionary or set (``{}``)

   Given a query like ``SELECT COUNT(*) FROM foo``, it will fail only if
   the count ``== 0``. You can craft much more complex query that could,
   for instance, check that the table has the same number of rows as
   the source table upstream, or that the count of today's partition is
   greater than yesterday's partition, or that a set of metrics are less
   than 3 standard deviation for the 7 day average.

   This operator can be used as a data quality check in your pipeline, and
   depending on where you put it in your DAG, you have the choice to
   stop the critical path, preventing from
   publishing dubious data, or on the side and receive email alerts
   without stopping the progress of the DAG.

   :param sql: the sql to be executed
   :param gcp_conn_id: (Optional) The connection ID used to connect to Google Cloud.

       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first

   Bases: :py:obj:`_BigQueryDbHookMixin`, :py:obj:`airflow.operators.sql.SQLIntervalCheckOperator`

   Checks that the values of metrics given as SQL expressions are within
   a certain tolerance of the ones from days_back before.

   This method constructs a query like so ::

       SELECT {metrics_threshold_dict_key} FROM {table}
       WHERE {date_filter_column}=<date>

   .. seealso::
       For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
       :ref:`howto/operator:BigQueryIntervalCheckOperator`

   :param table: the table name
   :param days_back: number of days between ds and the ds we want to check
       against. Defaults to 7 days
   :param metrics_thresholds: a dictionary of ratios indexed by metrics, for
       example 'COUNT(*)': 1.5 would require a 50 percent or less difference
       between the current day, and the prior days_back.
   :param use_legacy_sql: Whether to use legacy SQL (true)
       or standard SQL (false).
   :param gcp_conn_id: (Optional) The connection ID used to connect to Google Cloud.

       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).
   :param labels: a dictionary containing labels for the table, passed to BigQuery

   .. py:attribute:: template_fields

.. py:class:: BigQueryGetDataOperator(*, dataset_id, table_id, max_results = 100, selected_fields = None, gcp_conn_id = 'google_cloud_default', delegate_to = None, location = None, impersonation_chain = None, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.models.BaseOperator`

   Fetches the data from a BigQuery table (alternatively fetch data for selected columns)
   and returns data in a python list. The number of elements in the returned list will
   be equal to the number of rows fetched. Each element in the list will again be a list
   where element would represent the columns values for that row.

   **Example Result**: ``[['Tony', '10'], ['Mike', '20'], ['Steve', '15']]``

   .. seealso::
       For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
       :ref:`howto/operator:BigQueryGetDataOperator`

   .. note::
       If you pass fields to ``selected_fields`` which are in different order than the
       order of columns already in
       BQ table, the data will still be in the order of BQ table.
       For example if the BQ table has 3 columns as
       ``[A,B,C]`` and you pass 'B,A' in the ``selected_fields``
       the data would still be of the form ``'A,B'``.

   **Example**: ::

       get_data = BigQueryGetDataOperator(
           task_id='get_data_from_bq',
           dataset_id='test_dataset',
           table_id='Transaction_partitions',
           max_results=100,

   :param max_results: The maximum number of records (rows) to be fetched
       from the table. (templated)
   :param selected_fields: List of fields to return (comma-separated). If
       unspecified, all fields are returned.
   :param gcp_conn_id: (Optional) The connection ID used to connect to Google Cloud.
   :param delegate_to: The account to impersonate using domain-wide delegation of authority,
       if any. For this to work, the service account making the request must have
       domain-wide delegation enabled.
   :param location: The location used for the operation.
   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
       of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).

       all nested and repeated fields in the query results. ``allow_large_results``
       must be ``true`` if this is set to ``false``. For standard SQL queries, this
       flag is ignored and results are never flattened.
   :param gcp_conn_id: (Optional) The connection ID used to connect to Google Cloud.
   :param delegate_to: The account to impersonate using domain-wide delegation of authority,
       if any. For this to work, the service account making the request must have

       if you need to provide some params that are not supported by BigQueryOperator
       like args.
   :param schema_update_options: Allows the schema of the destination
       table to be updated as a side effect of the load job.
   :param query_params: a list of dictionary containing query parameter types and
       values, passed to BigQuery. The structure of dictionary should look like
       'queryParameters' in Google BigQuery Jobs API:
       https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs.
       For example, [{ 'name': 'corpus', 'parameterType': { 'type': 'STRING' },
       'parameterValue': { 'value': 'romeoandjuliet' } }]. (templated)
   :param labels: a dictionary containing labels for the job/query,

       US and EU. See details at
       https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations#specifying_your_location
   :param encryption_configuration: [Optional] Custom encryption configuration (e.g., Cloud KMS keys).
       **Example**: ::

           encryption_configuration = {

      Refer to get_template_context for more context.


   .. py:method:: on_kill(self)

      Override this method to cleanup subprocesses when a task instance
      gets killed. Any use of the threading, subprocess or multiprocessing
      module within an operator needs to be cleaned up or it will leave
      ghost processes behind.

   Creates a new, empty table in the specified BigQuery dataset,
   optionally with schema.

   The schema to be used for the BigQuery table may be specified in one of
   two ways. You may either directly pass the schema fields in, or you may
   point the operator to a Google Cloud Storage object name. The object in
   Google Cloud Storage must be a JSON file with the schema fields in it.
   You can also create a table without schema.

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.models.BaseOperator`

   Executes a BigQuery job. Waits for the job to complete and returns job id.
   This operator work in the following way:

   - it calculates a unique hash of the job using job's configuration or uuid if ``force_rerun`` is True
   - creates ``job_id`` in form of
       ``[provided_job_id | airflow_{dag_id}_{task_id}_{exec_date}]_{uniqueness_suffix}``
   - submits a BigQuery job using the ``job_id``
   - if job with given id already exists then it tries to reattach to the job if its not done and its
       state is in ``reattach_states``. If the job is done the operator will raise ``AirflowException``.

   Using ``force_rerun`` will submit a new job every time without attaching to already existing ones.

   For job definition see here:

       https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/v2/jobs

   .. seealso::
       For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:

   :param configuration: The configuration parameter maps directly to BigQuery's
       configuration field in the job  object. For more details see
       https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/v2/jobs
   :param job_id: The ID of the job. It will be suffixed with hash of job configuration
       unless ``force_rerun`` is True.
       The ID must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), or
       dashes (-). The maximum length is 1,024 characters. If not provided then uuid will
       be generated.
   :param force_rerun: If True then operator will use hash of uuid as job id suffix
   :param reattach_states: Set of BigQuery job's states in case of which we should reattach
       to the job. Should be other than final states.
   :param project_id: Google Cloud Project where the job is running
   :param location: location the job is running
   :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID used to connect to Google Cloud.
   :param delegate_to: The account to impersonate using domain-wide delegation of authority,
       if any. For this to work, the service account making the request must have
       domain-wide delegation enabled.
   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
       of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).
   :param cancel_on_kill: Flag which indicates whether cancel the hook's job or not, when on_kill is called
   :param result_retry: How to retry the `result` call that retrieves rows
   :param result_timeout: The number of seconds to wait for `result` method before using `result_retry`

      Hook triggered after the templated fields get replaced by their content.

      If you need your operator to alter the content of the file before the
      template is rendered, it should override this method to do so.


   .. py:method:: execute(self, context)

      This is the main method to derive when creating an operator.
      Context is the same dictionary used as when rendering jinja templates.

      Refer to get_template_context for more context.


   .. py:method:: on_kill(self)

      Override this method to cleanup subprocesses when a task instance
      gets killed. Any use of the threading, subprocess or multiprocessing
      module within an operator needs to be cleaned up or it will leave
      ghost processes behind.
