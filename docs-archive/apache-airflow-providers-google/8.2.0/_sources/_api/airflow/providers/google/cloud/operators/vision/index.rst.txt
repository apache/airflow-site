   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.models.BaseOperator`

   Creates a new ProductSet resource.

   .. seealso::
       For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
       :ref:`howto/operator:CloudVisionCreateProductSetOperator`

   :param product_set: (Required) The ProductSet to create. If a dict is provided, it must be of the same
       form as the protobuf message `ProductSet`.
   :param location: (Required) The region where the ProductSet should be created. Valid regions
       (as of 2019-02-05) are: us-east1, us-west1, europe-west1, asia-east1
   :param project_id: (Optional) The project in which the ProductSet should be created. If set to None or
       missing, the default project_id from the Google Cloud connection is used.
   :param product_set_id: (Optional) A user-supplied resource id for this ProductSet.
       If set, the server will attempt to use this value as the resource id. If it is
       already in use, an error is returned with code ALREADY_EXISTS. Must be at most
       128 characters long. It cannot contain the character /.
   :param retry: (Optional) A retry object used to retry requests. If `None` is
       specified, requests will not be retried.
   :param timeout: (Optional) The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the request to
       complete. Note that if retry is specified, the timeout applies to each individual
       attempt.
   :param metadata: (Optional) Additional metadata that is provided to the method.
   :param gcp_conn_id: (Optional) The connection ID used to connect to Google Cloud.
   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
       of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.

       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.models.BaseOperator`

   Makes changes to a `ProductSet` resource. Only display_name can be updated currently.

   .. note:: To locate the `ProductSet` resource, its `name` in the form
       `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOC_ID/productSets/PRODUCT_SET_ID` is necessary.

   You can provide the `name` directly as an attribute of the `product_set` object.
   However, you can leave it blank and provide `location` and `product_set_id` instead
   (and optionally `project_id` - if not present, the connection default will be used)
   and the `name` will be created by the operator itself.

   This mechanism exists for your convenience, to allow leaving the `project_id` empty
   and having Airflow use the connection default `project_id`.

   :param project_id: (Optional) The project in which the ProductSet should be created. If set to None or
       missing, the default project_id from the Google Cloud connection is used.
   :param update_mask: (Optional) The `FieldMask` that specifies which fields to update. If update_mask
       isn't specified, all mutable fields are to be updated. Valid mask path is display_name. If a dict is
       provided, it must be of the same form as the protobuf message `FieldMask`.
   :param retry: (Optional) A retry object used to retry requests. If `None` is
       specified, requests will not be retried.
   :param timeout: (Optional) The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the request to
       complete. Note that if retry is specified, the timeout applies to each individual
