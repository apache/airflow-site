.. py:function:: get_object_id(obj)

   Returns unique id of the object.


.. py:class:: BiqQueryDataTransferServiceHook(gcp_conn_id = 'google_cloud_default', delegate_to = None, location = None, impersonation_chain = None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.google.common.hooks.base_google.GoogleBaseHook`

   Hook for Google Bigquery Transfer API.

   All the methods in the hook where ``project_id`` is used must be called with
   keyword arguments rather than positional.

   .. py:method:: get_conn()

      Retrieves connection to Google Bigquery.

      :return: Google Bigquery API client
      :rtype: google.cloud.bigquery_datatransfer_v1.DataTransferServiceClient


   .. py:method:: create_transfer_config(transfer_config, project_id = PROVIDE_PROJECT_ID, authorization_code = None, retry = DEFAULT, timeout = None, metadata = ())

      Creates a new data transfer configuration.

      :param transfer_config: Data transfer configuration to create.
      :param project_id: The BigQuery project id where the transfer configuration should be
          created. If set to None or missing, the default project_id from the Google Cloud connection
          is used.
      :param authorization_code: authorization code to use with this transfer configuration.
          This is required if new credentials are needed.
      :param retry: A retry object used to retry requests. If `None` is
          specified, requests will not be retried.
      :param timeout: The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the request to
          complete. Note that if retry is specified, the timeout applies to each individual
          attempt.
      :param metadata: Additional metadata that is provided to the method.
      :return: A ``google.cloud.bigquery_datatransfer_v1.types.TransferConfig`` instance.


   .. py:method:: delete_transfer_config(transfer_config_id, project_id = PROVIDE_PROJECT_ID, retry = DEFAULT, timeout = None, metadata = ())

      Deletes transfer configuration.

      :param transfer_config_id: Id of transfer config to be used.
      :param project_id: The BigQuery project id where the transfer configuration should be
          created. If set to None or missing, the default project_id from the Google Cloud connection
          is used.
      :param retry: A retry object used to retry requests. If `None` is
          specified, requests will not be retried.
      :param timeout: The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the request to
          complete. Note that if retry is specified, the timeout applies to each individual
          attempt.
      :param metadata: Additional metadata that is provided to the method.
      :return: None


   .. py:method:: start_manual_transfer_runs(transfer_config_id, project_id = PROVIDE_PROJECT_ID, requested_time_range = None, requested_run_time = None, retry = DEFAULT, timeout = None, metadata = ())

      Start manual transfer runs to be executed now with schedule_time equal
      to current time. The transfer runs can be created for a time range where
      the run_time is between start_time (inclusive) and end_time
      (exclusive), or for a specific run_time.

      :param transfer_config_id: Id of transfer config to be used.
      :param requested_time_range: Time range for the transfer runs that should be started.
          If a dict is provided, it must be of the same form as the protobuf
          message `~google.cloud.bigquery_datatransfer_v1.types.TimeRange`
      :param requested_run_time: Specific run_time for a transfer run to be started. The
          requested_run_time must not be in the future.  If a dict is provided, it
          must be of the same form as the protobuf message
          `~google.cloud.bigquery_datatransfer_v1.types.Timestamp`
      :param project_id: The BigQuery project id where the transfer configuration should be
          created. If set to None or missing, the default project_id from the Google Cloud connection
          is used.
      :param retry: A retry object used to retry requests. If `None` is
          specified, requests will not be retried.
      :param timeout: The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the request to
          complete. Note that if retry is specified, the timeout applies to each individual
          attempt.
      :param metadata: Additional metadata that is provided to the method.
      :return: An ``google.cloud.bigquery_datatransfer_v1.types.StartManualTransferRunsResponse`` instance.


   .. py:method:: get_transfer_run(run_id, transfer_config_id, project_id = PROVIDE_PROJECT_ID, retry = DEFAULT, timeout = None, metadata = ())

      Returns information about the particular transfer run.

      :param run_id: ID of the transfer run.
      :param transfer_config_id: ID of transfer config to be used.
      :param project_id: The BigQuery project id where the transfer configuration should be
          created. If set to None or missing, the default project_id from the Google Cloud connection
          is used.
      :param retry: A retry object used to retry requests. If `None` is
          specified, requests will not be retried.
      :param timeout: The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the request to

          attempt.
      :param metadata: Additional metadata that is provided to the method.
      :return: An ``google.cloud.bigquery_datatransfer_v1.types.TransferRun`` instance.
