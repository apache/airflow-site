   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.models.BaseOperator`

   Start a Google Cloud ML Engine prediction job.

   .. seealso::
       For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
       :ref:`howto/operator:MLEngineStartBatchPredictionJobOperator`

   NOTE: For model origin, users should consider exactly one from the
   three options below:

   1. Populate ``uri`` field only, which should be a GCS location that
      points to a tensorflow savedModel directory.
   2. Populate ``model_name`` field only, which refers to an existing
      model, and the default version of the model will be used.
   3. Populate both ``model_name`` and ``version_name`` fields, which
      refers to a specific version of a specific model.

   In options 2 and 3, both model and version name should contain the
   minimal identifier. For instance, call::

       MLEngineBatchPredictionOperator(
           ...,
           model_name='my_model',
           version_name='my_version',
           ...)

   if the desired model version is
   ``projects/my_project/models/my_model/versions/my_version``.

   See https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/reference/rest/v1/projects.jobs
   for further documentation on the parameters.

   :param job_id: A unique id for the prediction job on Google Cloud
       ML Engine. (templated)
   :param data_format: The format of the input data.
       It will default to 'DATA_FORMAT_UNSPECIFIED' if is not provided
       or is not one of ["TEXT", "TF_RECORD", "TF_RECORD_GZIP"].
   :param input_paths: A list of GCS paths of input data for batch
       prediction. Accepting wildcard operator ``*``, but only at the end. (templated)

       If version_name is not provided, the default version of this
       model will be used.
       Should not be None if version_name is provided.
       Should be None if uri is provided. (templated)
   :param version_name: The Google Cloud ML Engine model version to use for
       prediction.
       Should be None if uri is provided. (templated)
   :param uri: The GCS path of the saved model to use for prediction.

       It should be a GCS path pointing to a tensorflow SavedModel. (templated)
   :param max_worker_count: The maximum number of workers to be used
       for parallel processing. Defaults to 10 if not specified. Should be a
       string representing the worker count ("10" instead of 10, "50" instead
       of 50, etc.)
   :param runtime_version: The Google Cloud ML Engine runtime version to use
       for batch prediction.

   :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID used for connection to Google
       Cloud Platform.
   :param delegate_to: The account to impersonate using domain-wide delegation of authority,

       domain-wide delegation enabled.
   :param labels: a dictionary containing labels for the job; passed to BigQuery
   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
       of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).

   :raises: ``ValueError``: if a unique model/version origin cannot be
       determined.

       if any. For this to work, the service account making the request must have
       domain-wide delegation enabled.
   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
       of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).

   :param job_id: A unique templated id for the submitted Google MLEngine
       training job. (templated)
   :param region: The Google Compute Engine region to run the MLEngine training
       job in (templated).
   :param package_uris: A list of Python package locations for the training
       job, which should include the main training program and any additional
       dependencies. This is mutually exclusive with a custom image specified
       via master_config. (templated)
   :param training_python_module: The name of the Python module to run within
       the training job after installing the packages. This is mutually
       exclusive with a custom image specified via master_config. (templated)
   :param training_args: A list of command-line arguments to pass to the
       training program. (templated)
   :param scale_tier: Resource tier for MLEngine training job. (templated)
   :param master_type: The type of virtual machine to use for the master
       worker. It must be set whenever scale_tier is CUSTOM. (templated)
   :param master_config: The configuration for the master worker. If this is
       provided, master_type must be set as well. If a custom image is
       specified, this is mutually exclusive with package_uris and
       training_python_module. (templated)
   :param runtime_version: The Google Cloud ML runtime version to use for
       training. (templated)
   :param python_version: The version of Python used in training. (templated)

       outputs and other data needed for training. (templated)
   :param service_account: Optional service account to use when running the training application.
       (templated)
       The specified service account must have the `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` role. The
       Google-managed Cloud ML Engine service account must have the `iam.serviceAccountAdmin` role
       for the specified service account.
       If set to None or missing, the Google-managed Cloud ML Engine service account will be used.
   :param project_id: The Google Cloud project name within which MLEngine training job should run.
       If set to None or missing, the default project_id from the Google Cloud connection is used.
       (templated)
   :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use when fetching connection info.
   :param delegate_to: The account to impersonate using domain-wide delegation of authority,
       if any. For this to work, the service account making the request must have
       domain-wide delegation enabled.
   :param mode: Can be one of 'DRY_RUN'/'CLOUD'. In 'DRY_RUN' mode, no real
       training job will be launched, but the MLEngine training job request
       will be printed out. In 'CLOUD' mode, a real MLEngine training job
       creation request will be issued.
   :param labels: a dictionary containing labels for the job; passed to BigQuery
   :param hyperparameters: Optional HyperparameterSpec dictionary for hyperparameter tuning.
