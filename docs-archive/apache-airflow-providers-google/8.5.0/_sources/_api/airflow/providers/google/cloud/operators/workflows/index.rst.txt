   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.models.BaseOperator`

   Creates a new workflow. If a workflow with the specified name
   already exists in the specified project and location, the long
   running operation will return
   [ALREADY_EXISTS][google.rpc.Code.ALREADY_EXISTS] error.

       For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
       :ref:`howto/operator:WorkflowsCreateWorkflowOperator`

   :param workflow: Required. Workflow to be created.
   :param workflow_id: Required. The ID of the workflow to be created.
   :param project_id: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud project the cluster belongs to.
   :param location: Required. The GCP region in which to handle the request.
   :param retry: A retry object used to retry requests. If ``None`` is specified, requests will not be
       retried.
   :param timeout: The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the request to complete. Note that if
       ``retry`` is specified, the timeout applies to each individual attempt.

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.models.BaseOperator`

   Updates an existing workflow.
   Running this method has no impact on already running
   executions of the workflow. A new revision of the
   workflow may be created as a result of a successful
   update operation. In that case, such revision will be
   used in new workflow executions.
