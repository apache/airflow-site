   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.models.BaseOperator`

   Creates an Endpoint.

   :param project_id: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud project that the service belongs to.
   :param region: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud region that the service belongs to.
   :param endpoint: Required. The Endpoint to create.
   :param endpoint_id: The ID of Endpoint. This value should be 1-10 characters, and valid characters
       are /[0-9]/. If not provided, Vertex AI will generate a value for this ID.
   :param retry: Designation of what errors, if any, should be retried.
   :param timeout: The timeout for this request.
   :param metadata: Strings which should be sent along with the request as metadata.
   :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use connecting to Google Cloud.
   :param delegate_to: The account to impersonate using domain-wide delegation of authority,
       if any. For this to work, the service account making the request must have
       domain-wide delegation enabled.
   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
       of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).
