           ``validation``, ``test``}, and it defines to which set the
           given piece of data is assigned. If for a piece of data the

       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).
