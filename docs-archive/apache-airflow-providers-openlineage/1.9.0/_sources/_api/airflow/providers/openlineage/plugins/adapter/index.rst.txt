.. py:class:: OpenLineageAdapter(client = None, secrets_masker = None)


   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.utils.log.logging_mixin.LoggingMixin`

   Translate Airflow metadata to OpenLineage events instead of creating them from Airflow code.

   .. py:method:: complete_task(run_id, job_name, parent_job_name, parent_run_id, end_time, task)

      Emit openlineage event of type COMPLETE.

      :param run_id: globally unique identifier of task in dag run
      :param job_name: globally unique identifier of task between dags
      :param parent_job_name: the name of the parent job (typically the DAG,
