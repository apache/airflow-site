   Extract executed source code and put it into SourceCodeJobFacet.

   This extractor provides visibility on what particular task does by extracting
   executed source code and putting it into SourceCodeJobFacet. It does not extract

   .. py:method:: get_operator_classnames()
      :classmethod:


      Get a list of operators that extractor works for.

      This is an abstract method that subclasses should implement. There are
      operators that work very similarly and one extractor can cover.
