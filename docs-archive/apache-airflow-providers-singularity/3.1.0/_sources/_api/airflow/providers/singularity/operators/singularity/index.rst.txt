   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.models.BaseOperator`

   Execute a command inside a Singularity container

   Singularity has more seamless connection to the host than Docker, so
   no special binds are needed to ensure binding content in the user $HOME
   and temporary directories. If the user needs custom binds, this can
   be done with --volumes

   :param image: Singularity image or URI from which to create the container.
   :param auto_remove: Delete the container when the process exits.
       The default is False.
   :param command: Command to be run in the container. (templated)
   :param start_command: Start command to pass to the container instance.
   :param environment: Environment variables to set in the container. (templated)
   :param working_dir: Set a working directory for the instance.
   :param force_pull: Pull the image on every run. Default is False.
   :param volumes: List of volumes to mount into the container, e.g.
       ``['/host/path:/container/path', '/host/path2:/container/path2']``.
   :param options: Other flags (list) to provide to the instance start.
   :param working_dir: Working directory to
       set on the container (equivalent to the -w switch the docker client).

   .. py:method:: execute(context)

      This is the main method to derive when creating an operator.
      Context is the same dictionary used as when rendering jinja templates.

      Refer to get_template_context for more context.


   .. py:method:: on_kill()

      Override this method to clean up subprocesses when a task instance
      gets killed. Any use of the threading, subprocess or multiprocessing
      module within an operator needs to be cleaned up, or it will leave
      ghost processes behind.
