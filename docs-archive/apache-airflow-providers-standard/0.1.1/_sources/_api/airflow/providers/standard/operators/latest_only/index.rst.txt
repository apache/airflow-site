.. py:class:: LatestOnlyOperator(pre_execute=None, post_execute=None, on_execute_callback = None, on_failure_callback = None, on_success_callback = None, on_retry_callback = None, on_skipped_callback = None, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.operators.branch.BaseBranchOperator`


   Skip tasks that are not running during the most recent schedule interval.

   If the task is run outside the latest schedule interval (i.e. run_type == DagRunType.MANUAL),
   all directly downstream tasks will be skipped.

   Note that downstream tasks are never skipped if the given DAG_Run is
   marked as externally triggered.


   .. py:attribute:: ui_color
      :value: '#e9ffdb'



   .. py:method:: choose_branch(context)

      Abstract method to choose which branch to run.

      Subclasses should implement this, running whatever logic is
      necessary to choose a branch and returning a task_id or list of
      task_ids.

      :param context: Context dictionary as passed to execute()
