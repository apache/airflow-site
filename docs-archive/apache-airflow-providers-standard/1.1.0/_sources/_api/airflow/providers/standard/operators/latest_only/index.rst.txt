.. py:class:: LatestOnlyOperator(**kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.standard.operators.branch.BaseBranchOperator`


   Skip tasks that are not running during the most recent schedule interval.

   If the task is run outside the latest schedule interval (i.e. run_type == DagRunType.MANUAL),
   all directly downstream tasks will be skipped.

   Note that downstream tasks are never skipped if the given DAG_Run is
   marked as externally triggered.

   Note that when used with timetables that produce zero-length or point-in-time data intervals
   (e.g., ``DeltaTriggerTimetable``), this operator assumes each run is the latest
   and does not skip downstream tasks.

   .. py:method:: choose_branch(context)

      Abstract method to choose which branch to run.

      Subclasses should implement this, running whatever logic is
      necessary to choose a branch and returning a task_id or list of
      task_ids.

      :param context: Context dictionary as passed to execute()
