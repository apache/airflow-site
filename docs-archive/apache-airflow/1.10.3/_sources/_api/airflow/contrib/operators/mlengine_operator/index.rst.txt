.. function:: _normalize_mlengine_job_id(job_id)

   
   Replaces invalid MLEngine job_id characters with '_'.

   This also adds a leading 'z' in case job_id starts with an invalid
   character.

   Args:
       job_id: A job_id str that may have invalid characters.

   Returns:
       A valid job_id representation.

   









.. py:class:: MLEngineBatchPredictionOperator(project_id, job_id, region, data_format, input_paths, output_path, model_name=None, version_name=None, uri=None, max_worker_count=None, runtime_version=None, gcp_conn_id='google_cloud_default', delegate_to=None, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases::class:`airflow.operators.BaseOperator`

   

   Start a Google Cloud ML Engine prediction job.

   NOTE: For model origin, users should consider exactly one from the
   three options below:

   1. Populate ``uri`` field only, which should be a GCS location that
      points to a tensorflow savedModel directory.
   2. Populate ``model_name`` field only, which refers to an existing
      model, and the default version of the model will be used.
   3. Populate both ``model_name`` and ``version_name`` fields, which
      refers to a specific version of a specific model.

   In options 2 and 3, both model and version name should contain the
   minimal identifier. For instance, call::

       MLEngineBatchPredictionOperator(
           ...,
           model_name='my_model',
           version_name='my_version',
           ...)

   if the desired model version is
   ``projects/my_project/models/my_model/versions/my_version``.

   See https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/reference/rest/v1/projects.jobs
   for further documentation on the parameters.
