.. py:class:: S3DeleteObjectsOperator(bucket, keys, aws_conn_id='aws_default', verify=None, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :class:`airflow.models.BaseOperator`

   To enable users to delete single object or multiple objects from
   a bucket using a single HTTP request.

   Users may specify up to 1000 keys to delete.

   :param bucket: Name of the bucket in which you are going to delete object(s). (templated)
   :type bucket: str
   :param keys: The key(s) to delete from S3 bucket. (templated)

       When ``keys`` is a string, it's supposed to be the key name of
       the single object to delete.

       When ``keys`` is a list, it's supposed to be the list of the
       keys to delete.

       You may specify up to 1000 keys.
   :type keys: str or list
   :param aws_conn_id: Connection id of the S3 connection to use
   :type aws_conn_id: str
   :param verify: Whether or not to verify SSL certificates for S3 connection.
       By default SSL certificates are verified.

       You can provide the following values:

       - ``False``: do not validate SSL certificates. SSL will still be used,
                but SSL certificates will not be
                verified.
       - ``path/to/cert/bundle.pem``: A filename of the CA cert bundle to uses.
                You can specify this argument if you want to use a different
                CA cert bundle than the one used by botocore.
   :type verify: bool or str
