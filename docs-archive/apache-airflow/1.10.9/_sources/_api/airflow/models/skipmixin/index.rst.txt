   .. method:: skip(self, dag_run, execution_date, tasks, session=None)

      Sets tasks instances to skipped from the same dag run.

      :param dag_run: the DagRun for which to set the tasks to skipped
      :param execution_date: execution_date
      :param tasks: tasks to skip (not task_ids)
      :param session: db session to use



   
   .. method:: skip_all_except(self, ti, branch_task_ids)

      This method implements the logic for a branching operator; given a single
      task ID or list of task IDs to follow, this skips all other tasks
      immediately downstream of this operator.
