.. py:class:: BashOperator(*, bash_command, env = None, append_env = False, output_encoding = 'utf-8', skip_exit_code = None, skip_on_exit_code = 99, cwd = None, output_processor = lambda result: result, **kwargs)


   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.models.baseoperator.BaseOperator`

   Execute a Bash script, command or set of commands.

   .. seealso::
       For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
       :ref:`howto/operator:BashOperator`

   If BaseOperator.do_xcom_push is True, the last line written to stdout
   will also be pushed to an XCom when the bash command completes

   :param bash_command: The command, set of commands or reference to a
       Bash script (must be '.sh' or '.bash') to be executed. (templated)
   :param env: If env is not None, it must be a dict that defines the
       environment variables for the new process; these are used instead
       of inheriting the current process environment, which is the default
       behavior. (templated)
   :param append_env: If False(default) uses the environment variables passed in env params
       and does not inherit the current process environment. If True, inherits the environment variables
       from current passes and then environment variable passed by the user will either update the existing
       inherited environment variables or the new variables gets appended to it
   :param output_encoding: Output encoding of Bash command
   :param skip_on_exit_code: If task exits with this exit code, leave the task
       in ``skipped`` state (default: 99). If set to ``None``, any non-zero
       exit code will be treated as a failure.
   :param cwd: Working directory to execute the command in (templated).
       If None (default), the command is run in a temporary directory.
       To use current DAG folder as the working directory,
       you might set template ``{{ dag_run.dag.folder }}``.
   :param output_processor: Function to further process the output of the bash script
       (default is lambda output: output).

   Airflow will evaluate the exit code of the Bash command. In general, a non-zero exit code will result in
   task failure and zero will result in task success.
   Exit code ``99`` (or another set in ``skip_on_exit_code``)
   will throw an :class:`airflow.exceptions.AirflowSkipException`, which will leave the task in ``skipped``
   state. You can have all non-zero exit codes be treated as a failure by setting ``skip_on_exit_code=None``.

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 25 25

      * - Exit code
        - Behavior
      * - 0
        - success

        - raise :class:`airflow.exceptions.AirflowSkipException`
      * - otherwise
        - raise :class:`airflow.exceptions.AirflowException`

   .. note::

       Airflow will not recognize a non-zero exit code unless the whole shell exit with a non-zero exit
       code.  This can be an issue if the non-zero exit arises from a sub-command.  The easiest way of
       addressing this is to prefix the command with ``set -e;``

       .. code-block:: python

           bash_command = "set -e; python3 script.py '{{ next_execution_date }}'"

   .. note::

       Add a space after the script name when directly calling a ``.sh`` script with the
       ``bash_command`` argument -- for example ``bash_command="my_script.sh "``.  This
       is because Airflow tries to apply load this file and process it as a Jinja template to
       it ends with ``.sh``, which will likely not be what most users want.

   .. warning::

       Care should be taken with "user" input or when using Jinja templates in the
       ``bash_command``, as this bash operator does not perform any escaping or
       sanitization of the command.

       This applies mostly to using "dag_run" conf, as that can be submitted via
       users in the Web UI. Most of the default template variables are not at
       risk.

   For example, do **not** do this:

   .. code-block:: python

       bash_task = BashOperator(
           task_id="bash_task",
           bash_command='echo "Here is the message: \'{{ dag_run.conf["message"] if dag_run else "" }}\'"',
       )

   Instead, you should pass this via the ``env`` kwarg and use double-quotes
   inside the bash_command, as below:

   .. code-block:: python

       bash_task = BashOperator(
           task_id="bash_task",
           bash_command="echo \"here is the message: '$message'\"",
           env={"message": '{{ dag_run.conf["message"] if dag_run else "" }}'},
       )

   .. versionadded:: 2.10.0
      The `output_processor` parameter.


   .. py:attribute:: template_fields
      :type: Sequence[str]
      :value: ('bash_command', 'env', 'cwd')

      

   .. py:attribute:: template_fields_renderers

      

   .. py:attribute:: template_ext
      :type: Sequence[str]
      :value: ('.sh', '.bash')

      

   .. py:attribute:: ui_color
      :value: '#f0ede4'

      

   .. py:method:: subprocess_hook()

      Returns hook for running the bash command.


   .. py:method:: get_env(context)

      Build the set of environment variables to be exposed for the bash command.


   .. py:method:: execute(context)

      Derive when creating an operator.

      Context is the same dictionary used as when rendering jinja templates.

      Refer to get_template_context for more context.


   .. py:method:: on_kill()

      Override this method to clean up subprocesses when a task instance gets killed.

      Any use of the threading, subprocess or multiprocessing module within an
      operator needs to be cleaned up, or it will leave ghost processes behind.
