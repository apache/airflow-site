   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.executors.base_executor.BaseExecutor`

   DaskExecutor submits tasks to a Dask Distributed cluster.

   .. py:method:: start(self)

      Executors may need to get things started.


   .. py:method:: execute_async(self, key, command, queue = None, executor_config = None)

      This method will execute the command asynchronously.

      :param key: Unique key for the task instance
      :param command: Command to run
      :param queue: name of the queue
      :param executor_config: Configuration passed to the executor.


   .. py:method:: sync(self)

      Sync will get called periodically by the heartbeat method.
      Executors should override this to perform gather statuses.


   .. py:method:: end(self)

      This method is called when the caller is done submitting job and
      wants to wait synchronously for the job submitted previously to be
      all done.

      This method is called when the daemon receives a SIGTERM
