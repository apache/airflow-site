.. py:class:: DateTimeSensor(*, target_time, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.sensors.base.BaseSensorOperator`

   Waits until the specified datetime.

   A major advantage of this sensor is idempotence for the ``target_time``.
   It handles some cases for which ``TimeSensor`` and ``TimeDeltaSensor`` are not suited.

   **Example** 1 :
       If a task needs to wait for 11am on each ``execution_date``. Using
       ``TimeSensor`` or ``TimeDeltaSensor``, all backfill tasks started at
       1am have to wait for 10 hours. This is unnecessary, e.g. a backfill
       task with ``{{ ds }} = '1970-01-01'`` does not need to wait because
       ``1970-01-01T11:00:00`` has already passed.

   **Example** 2 :
       If a DAG is scheduled to run at 23:00 daily, but one of the tasks is
       required to run at 01:00 next day, using ``TimeSensor`` will return
       ``True`` immediately because 23:00 > 01:00. Instead, we can do this:

       .. code-block:: python

           DateTimeSensor(
               task_id="wait_for_0100",
               target_time="{{ next_execution_date.tomorrow().replace(hour=1) }}",
           )

   :param target_time: datetime after which the job succeeds. (templated)

   .. py:attribute:: template_fields
      :annotation: :Sequence[str] = ['target_time']

      

   .. py:method:: poke(self, context)

      Function that the sensors defined while deriving this class should
      override.



.. py:class:: DateTimeSensorAsync(*, target_time, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`DateTimeSensor`

   Waits until the specified datetime, deferring itself to avoid taking up
   a worker slot while it is waiting.

   It is a drop-in replacement for DateTimeSensor.

   :param target_time: datetime after which the job succeeds. (templated)

   .. py:method:: execute(self, context)

      This is the main method to derive when creating an operator.
      Context is the same dictionary used as when rendering jinja templates.

      Refer to get_template_context for more context.


   .. py:method:: execute_complete(self, context, event=None)

      Callback for when the trigger fires - returns immediately.
