   airflow.operators.weekday.BranchDayOfWeekOperator




.. py:class:: BranchDayOfWeekOperator(*, follow_task_ids_if_true, follow_task_ids_if_false, week_day, use_task_logical_date = False, use_task_execution_day = False, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.operators.branch.BaseBranchOperator`

   Branches into one of two lists of tasks depending on the current day.
   For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
   :ref:`howto/operator:BranchDayOfWeekOperator`

   **Example** (with single day): ::

       from airflow.operators.empty import EmptyOperator

       monday = EmptyOperator(task_id='monday')
       other_day = EmptyOperator(task_id='other_day')

       monday_check = DayOfWeekSensor(
           task_id='monday_check',
           week_day='Monday',
           use_task_logical_date=True,
           follow_task_ids_if_true='monday',
           follow_task_ids_if_false='other_day',
           dag=dag)
       monday_check >> [monday, other_day]

   **Example** (with :class:`~airflow.utils.weekday.WeekDay` enum): ::

       # import WeekDay Enum
       from airflow.utils.weekday import WeekDay
       from airflow.operators.empty import EmptyOperator

       workday = EmptyOperator(task_id='workday')
       weekend = EmptyOperator(task_id='weekend')
       weekend_check = BranchDayOfWeekOperator(
           task_id='weekend_check',
           week_day={WeekDay.SATURDAY, WeekDay.SUNDAY},
           use_task_logical_date=True,
           follow_task_ids_if_true='weekend',
           follow_task_ids_if_false='workday',
           dag=dag)
       # add downstream dependencies as you would do with any branch operator
       weekend_check >> [workday, weekend]

   :param follow_task_ids_if_true: task id or task ids to follow if criteria met
   :param follow_task_ids_if_false: task id or task ids to follow if criteria does not met
   :param week_day: Day of the week to check (full name). Optionally, a set
       of days can also be provided using a set.
       Example values:

           * ``"MONDAY"``,
           * ``{"Saturday", "Sunday"}``
           * ``{WeekDay.TUESDAY}``
           * ``{WeekDay.SATURDAY, WeekDay.SUNDAY}``

       To use `WeekDay` enum, import it from `airflow.utils.weekday`

   :param use_task_logical_date: If ``True``, uses task's logical date to compare
       with is_today. Execution Date is Useful for backfilling.
       If ``False``, uses system's day of the week.
   :param use_task_execution_day: deprecated parameter, same effect as `use_task_logical_date`

   .. py:method:: choose_branch(context)

      Subclasses should implement this, running whatever logic is
      necessary to choose a branch and returning a task_id or list of
      task_ids.

      :param context: Context dictionary as passed to execute()
