.. py:class:: BashSensor(*, bash_command, env=None, output_encoding='utf-8', retry_exit_code = None, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.sensors.base.BaseSensorOperator`

   Executes a bash command/script.

   Return True if and only if the return code is 0.

   :param bash_command: The command, set of commands or reference to a
       bash script (must be '.sh') to be executed.

   :param env: If env is not None, it must be a mapping that defines the
       environment variables for the new process; these are used instead
       of inheriting the current process environment, which is the default
       behavior. (templated)
   :param output_encoding: output encoding of bash command.
   :param retry_exit_code: If task exits with this code, treat the sensor
       as not-yet-complete and retry the check later according to the
       usual retry/timeout settings. Any other non-zero return code will
       be treated as an error, and cause the sensor to fail. If set to
       ``None`` (the default), any non-zero exit code will cause a retry
       and the task will never raise an error except on time-out.
