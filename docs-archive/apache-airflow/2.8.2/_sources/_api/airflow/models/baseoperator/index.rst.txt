   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.models.abstractoperator.AbstractOperator`

   Abstract base class for all operators.

   Since operators create objects that become nodes in the DAG, BaseOperator
   contains many recursive methods for DAG crawling behavior. To derive from
   this class, you are expected to override the constructor and the 'execute'
   method.

   Operators derived from this class should perform or trigger certain tasks
   synchronously (wait for completion). Example of operators could be an
   operator that runs a Pig job (PigOperator), a sensor operator that
   waits for a partition to land in Hive (HiveSensorOperator), or one that
   moves data from Hive to MySQL (Hive2MySqlOperator). Instances of these
   operators (tasks) target specific operations, running specific scripts,
   functions or data transfers.

   This class is abstract and shouldn't be instantiated. Instantiating a
   class derived from this one results in the creation of a task object,
   which ultimately becomes a node in DAG objects. Task dependencies should
   be set by using the set_upstream and/or set_downstream methods.

   :param task_id: a unique, meaningful id for the task
   :param owner: the owner of the task. Using a meaningful description
       (e.g. user/person/team/role name) to clarify ownership is recommended.
   :param email: the 'to' email address(es) used in email alerts. This can be a
       single email or multiple ones. Multiple addresses can be specified as a
       comma or semicolon separated string or by passing a list of strings.
   :param email_on_retry: Indicates whether email alerts should be sent when a
       task is retried
   :param email_on_failure: Indicates whether email alerts should be sent when
       a task failed
   :param retries: the number of retries that should be performed before
       failing the task
   :param retry_delay: delay between retries, can be set as ``timedelta`` or
       ``float`` seconds, which will be converted into ``timedelta``,
       the default is ``timedelta(seconds=300)``.
   :param retry_exponential_backoff: allow progressively longer waits between
       retries by using exponential backoff algorithm on retry delay (delay
       will be converted into seconds)
   :param max_retry_delay: maximum delay interval between retries, can be set as
       ``timedelta`` or ``float`` seconds, which will be converted into ``timedelta``.
   :param start_date: The ``start_date`` for the task, determines
       the ``execution_date`` for the first task instance. The best practice
       is to have the start_date rounded
       to your DAG's ``schedule_interval``. Daily jobs have their start_date
       some day at 00:00:00, hourly jobs have their start_date at 00:00
       of a specific hour. Note that Airflow simply looks at the latest
       ``execution_date`` and adds the ``schedule_interval`` to determine
       the next ``execution_date``. It is also very important
       to note that different tasks' dependencies
       need to line up in time. If task A depends on task B and their
       start_date are offset in a way that their execution_date don't line
       up, A's dependencies will never be met. If you are looking to delay
       a task, for example running a daily task at 2AM, look into the
       ``TimeSensor`` and ``TimeDeltaSensor``. We advise against using
       dynamic ``start_date`` and recommend using fixed ones. Read the
       FAQ entry about start_date for more information.
   :param end_date: if specified, the scheduler won't go beyond this date
   :param depends_on_past: when set to true, task instances will run
       sequentially and only if the previous instance has succeeded or has been skipped.
       The task instance for the start_date is allowed to run.
   :param wait_for_past_depends_before_skipping: when set to true, if the task instance
       should be marked as skipped, and depends_on_past is true, the ti will stay on None state
       waiting the task of the previous run
   :param wait_for_downstream: when set to true, an instance of task
       X will wait for tasks immediately downstream of the previous instance
       of task X to finish successfully or be skipped before it runs. This is useful if the
       different instances of a task X alter the same asset, and this asset
       is used by tasks downstream of task X. Note that depends_on_past
       is forced to True wherever wait_for_downstream is used. Also note that
       only tasks *immediately* downstream of the previous task instance are waited
       for; the statuses of any tasks further downstream are ignored.
   :param dag: a reference to the dag the task is attached to (if any)
   :param priority_weight: priority weight of this task against other task.
       This allows the executor to trigger higher priority tasks before
       others when things get backed up. Set priority_weight as a higher
       number for more important tasks.
   :param weight_rule: weighting method used for the effective total
       priority weight of the task. Options are:
       ``{ downstream | upstream | absolute }`` default is ``downstream``
       When set to ``downstream`` the effective weight of the task is the
       aggregate sum of all downstream descendants. As a result, upstream
       tasks will have higher weight and will be scheduled more aggressively
       when using positive weight values. This is useful when you have
       multiple dag run instances and desire to have all upstream tasks to
       complete for all runs before each dag can continue processing
       downstream tasks. When set to ``upstream`` the effective weight is the
       aggregate sum of all upstream ancestors. This is the opposite where
       downstream tasks have higher weight and will be scheduled more
       aggressively when using positive weight values. This is useful when you
       have multiple dag run instances and prefer to have each dag complete
       before starting upstream tasks of other dags.  When set to
       ``absolute``, the effective weight is the exact ``priority_weight``
       specified without additional weighting. You may want to do this when
       you know exactly what priority weight each task should have.
       Additionally, when set to ``absolute``, there is bonus effect of
       significantly speeding up the task creation process as for very large
       DAGs. Options can be set as string or using the constants defined in
       the static class ``airflow.utils.WeightRule``
   :param queue: which queue to target when running this job. Not
       all executors implement queue management, the CeleryExecutor
       does support targeting specific queues.
   :param pool: the slot pool this task should run in, slot pools are a
       way to limit concurrency for certain tasks
   :param pool_slots: the number of pool slots this task should use (>= 1)
       Values less than 1 are not allowed.
   :param sla: time by which the job is expected to succeed. Note that
       this represents the ``timedelta`` after the period is closed. For
       example if you set an SLA of 1 hour, the scheduler would send an email
       soon after 1:00AM on the ``2016-01-02`` if the ``2016-01-01`` instance
       has not succeeded yet.
       The scheduler pays special attention for jobs with an SLA and
       sends alert
       emails for SLA misses. SLA misses are also recorded in the database
       for future reference. All tasks that share the same SLA time
       get bundled in a single email, sent soon after that time. SLA
       notification are sent once and only once for each task instance.
   :param execution_timeout: max time allowed for the execution of
       this task instance, if it goes beyond it will raise and fail.
   :param on_failure_callback: a function or list of functions to be called when a task instance
       of this task fails. a context dictionary is passed as a single
       parameter to this function. Context contains references to related
       objects to the task instance and is documented under the macros
       section of the API.
   :param on_execute_callback: much like the ``on_failure_callback`` except
       that it is executed right before the task is executed.
   :param on_retry_callback: much like the ``on_failure_callback`` except
       that it is executed when retries occur.
   :param on_success_callback: much like the ``on_failure_callback`` except
       that it is executed when the task succeeds.
   :param pre_execute: a function to be called immediately before task
       execution, receiving a context dictionary; raising an exception will
       prevent the task from being executed.

       |experimental|
   :param post_execute: a function to be called immediately after task
       execution, receiving a context dictionary and task result; raising an
       exception will prevent the task from succeeding.

       |experimental|
   :param trigger_rule: defines the rule by which dependencies are applied
       for the task to get triggered. Options are:
       ``{ all_success | all_failed | all_done | all_skipped | one_success | one_done |
       one_failed | none_failed | none_failed_min_one_success | none_skipped | always}``
       default is ``all_success``. Options can be set as string or
       using the constants defined in the static class
       ``airflow.utils.TriggerRule``
   :param resources: A map of resource parameter names (the argument names of the
       Resources constructor) to their values.
   :param run_as_user: unix username to impersonate while running the task
   :param max_active_tis_per_dag: When set, a task will be able to limit the concurrent
       runs across execution_dates.
   :param max_active_tis_per_dagrun: When set, a task will be able to limit the concurrent
       task instances per DAG run.
   :param executor_config: Additional task-level configuration parameters that are
       interpreted by a specific executor. Parameters are namespaced by the name of
       executor.

       **Example**: to run this task in a specific docker container through
       the KubernetesExecutor ::

           MyOperator(..., executor_config={"KubernetesExecutor": {"image": "myCustomDockerImage"}})

   :param do_xcom_push: if True, an XCom is pushed containing the Operator's
       result
   :param task_group: The TaskGroup to which the task should belong. This is typically provided when not
       using a TaskGroup as a context manager.
   :param doc: Add documentation or notes to your Task objects that is visible in
       Task Instance details View in the Webserver
   :param doc_md: Add documentation (in Markdown format) or notes to your Task objects
       that is visible in Task Instance details View in the Webserver
   :param doc_rst: Add documentation (in RST format) or notes to your Task objects
       that is visible in Task Instance details View in the Webserver
   :param doc_json: Add documentation (in JSON format) or notes to your Task objects
       that is visible in Task Instance details View in the Webserver
   :param doc_yaml: Add documentation (in YAML format) or notes to your Task objects
       that is visible in Task Instance details View in the Webserver
   :param logger_name: Name of the logger used by the Operator to emit logs.
       If set to `None` (default), the logger name will fall back to
       `airflow.task.operators.{class.__module__}.{class.__name__}` (e.g. SimpleHttpOperator will have
       *airflow.task.operators.airflow.providers.http.operators.http.SimpleHttpOperator* as logger).

   .. py:method:: set_xcomargs_dependencies()

      Resolve upstream dependencies of a task.

      In this way passing an ``XComArg`` as value for a template field
      will result in creating upstream relation between two tasks.

      **Example**: ::

          with DAG(...):
              generate_content = GenerateContentOperator(task_id="generate_content")
              send_email = EmailOperator(..., html_content=generate_content.output)

          # This is equivalent to
          with DAG(...):
              generate_content = GenerateContentOperator(task_id="generate_content")
              send_email = EmailOperator(..., html_content="{{ task_instance.xcom_pull('generate_content') }}")
              generate_content >> send_email



   .. py:method:: pre_execute(context)

      Execute right before self.execute() is called.


   .. py:method:: execute(context)
      :abstractmethod:

      Derive when creating an operator.

      Context is the same dictionary used as when rendering jinja templates.

      Refer to get_template_context for more context.


   .. py:method:: post_execute(context, result = None)

      Execute right after self.execute() is called.

      It is passed the execution context and any results returned by the operator.


   .. py:method:: on_kill()

      Override this method to clean up subprocesses when a task instance gets killed.

      Any use of the threading, subprocess or multiprocessing module within an
      operator needs to be cleaned up, or it will leave ghost processes behind.


   .. py:method:: __deepcopy__(memo)


   .. py:method:: __getstate__()


   .. py:method:: __setstate__(state)


   .. py:method:: render_template_fields(context, jinja_env = None)

      Template all attributes listed in *self.template_fields*.

      This mutates the attributes in-place and is irreversible.

      :param context: Context dict with values to apply on content.
      :param jinja_env: Jinja's environment to use for rendering.


   .. py:method:: clear(start_date = None, end_date = None, upstream = False, downstream = False, session = NEW_SESSION)

      Clear the state of task instances associated with the task, following the parameters specified.


   .. py:method:: get_task_instances(start_date = None, end_date = None, session = NEW_SESSION)

      Get task instances related to this task for a specific date range.


   .. py:method:: run(start_date = None, end_date = None, ignore_first_depends_on_past = True, wait_for_past_depends_before_skipping = False, ignore_ti_state = False, mark_success = False, test_mode = False, session = NEW_SESSION)

      Run a set of task instances for a date range.


   .. py:method:: dry_run()

      Perform dry run for the operator - just render template fields.


   .. py:method:: get_direct_relatives(upstream = False)

      Get list of the direct relatives to the current task, upstream or downstream.


   .. py:method:: __repr__()

      Return repr(self).


   .. py:method:: xcom_push(context, key, value, execution_date = None)
      :staticmethod:

      Make an XCom available for tasks to pull.

      :param context: Execution Context Dictionary
      :param key: A key for the XCom
      :param value: A value for the XCom. The value is pickled and stored
          in the database.
      :param execution_date: if provided, the XCom will not be visible until
          this date. This can be used, for example, to send a message to a
          task on a future date without it being immediately visible.


   .. py:method:: xcom_pull(context, task_ids = None, dag_id = None, key = XCOM_RETURN_KEY, include_prior_dates = None, session = NEW_SESSION)
      :staticmethod:

      Pull XComs that optionally meet certain criteria.

      The default value for `key` limits the search to XComs
      that were returned by other tasks (as opposed to those that were pushed
      manually). To remove this filter, pass key=None (or any desired value).

      If a single task_id string is provided, the result is the value of the
      most recent matching XCom from that task_id. If multiple task_ids are
      provided, a tuple of matching values is returned. None is returned
      whenever no matches are found.

      :param context: Execution Context Dictionary
      :param key: A key for the XCom. If provided, only XComs with matching
          keys will be returned. The default key is 'return_value', also
          available as a constant XCOM_RETURN_KEY. This key is automatically
          given to XComs returned by tasks (as opposed to being pushed
          manually). To remove the filter, pass key=None.
      :param task_ids: Only XComs from tasks with matching ids will be
          pulled. Can pass None to remove the filter.
      :param dag_id: If provided, only pulls XComs from this DAG.
          If None (default), the DAG of the calling task is used.
      :param include_prior_dates: If False, only XComs from the current
          execution_date are returned. If True, XComs from previous dates
          are returned as well.


   .. py:method:: get_serialized_fields()
      :classmethod:

      Stringified DAGs and operators contain exactly these fields.


   .. py:method:: serialize_for_task_group()

      Serialize; required by DAGNode.


   .. py:method:: defer(*, trigger, method_name, kwargs = None, timeout = None)

      Mark this Operator "deferred", suspending its execution until the provided trigger fires an event.

      This is achieved by raising a special exception (TaskDeferred)
      which is caught in the main _execute_task wrapper.


   .. py:method:: resume_execution(next_method, next_kwargs, context)

      This method is called when a deferred task is resumed.



.. py:data:: Chainable

   

.. py:function:: chain(*tasks)

   Given a number of tasks, builds a dependency chain.

   This function accepts values of BaseOperator (aka tasks), EdgeModifiers (aka Labels), XComArg, TaskGroups,
   or lists containing any mix of these types (or a mix in the same list). If you want to chain between two
   lists you must ensure they have the same length.

   Using classic operators/sensors:

   .. code-block:: python

       chain(t1, [t2, t3], [t4, t5], t6)

   is equivalent to::

         / -> t2 -> t4 \
       t1               -> t6
         \ -> t3 -> t5 /

   .. code-block:: python

       t1.set_downstream(t2)
       t1.set_downstream(t3)
       t2.set_downstream(t4)
       t3.set_downstream(t5)
       t4.set_downstream(t6)
       t5.set_downstream(t6)

   Using task-decorated functions aka XComArgs:

   .. code-block:: python

       chain(x1(), [x2(), x3()], [x4(), x5()], x6())

   is equivalent to::

         / -> x2 -> x4 \
       x1               -> x6
         \ -> x3 -> x5 /

   .. code-block:: python

       x1 = x1()
       x2 = x2()
       x3 = x3()
       x4 = x4()
       x5 = x5()
       x6 = x6()
       x1.set_downstream(x2)
       x1.set_downstream(x3)
       x2.set_downstream(x4)
       x3.set_downstream(x5)
       x4.set_downstream(x6)
       x5.set_downstream(x6)

   Using TaskGroups:

   .. code-block:: python

       chain(t1, task_group1, task_group2, t2)

       t1.set_downstream(task_group1)
       task_group1.set_downstream(task_group2)
       task_group2.set_downstream(t2)


   It is also possible to mix between classic operator/sensor, EdgeModifiers, XComArg, and TaskGroups:

   .. code-block:: python

       chain(t1, [Label("branch one"), Label("branch two")], [x1(), x2()], task_group1, x3())

   is equivalent to::

         / "branch one" -> x1 \
       t1                      -> task_group1 -> x3
         \ "branch two" -> x2 /

   .. code-block:: python

       x1 = x1()
       x2 = x2()
       x3 = x3()
       label1 = Label("branch one")
       label2 = Label("branch two")
       t1.set_downstream(label1)
       label1.set_downstream(x1)
       t2.set_downstream(label2)
       label2.set_downstream(x2)
       x1.set_downstream(task_group1)
       x2.set_downstream(task_group1)
       task_group1.set_downstream(x3)

       # or

       x1 = x1()
       x2 = x2()
       x3 = x3()
       t1.set_downstream(x1, edge_modifier=Label("branch one"))
       t1.set_downstream(x2, edge_modifier=Label("branch two"))
       x1.set_downstream(task_group1)
       x2.set_downstream(task_group1)
       task_group1.set_downstream(x3)


   :param tasks: Individual and/or list of tasks, EdgeModifiers, XComArgs, or TaskGroups to set dependencies


.. py:function:: cross_downstream(from_tasks, to_tasks)

   Set downstream dependencies for all tasks in from_tasks to all tasks in to_tasks.

   Using classic operators/sensors:

   .. code-block:: python

       cross_downstream(from_tasks=[t1, t2, t3], to_tasks=[t4, t5, t6])

   is equivalent to::

       t1 ---> t4
          \ /
       t2 -X -> t5
          / \
       t3 ---> t6

   .. code-block:: python

       t1.set_downstream(t4)
       t1.set_downstream(t5)
       t1.set_downstream(t6)

       t2.set_downstream(t5)
       t2.set_downstream(t6)
       t3.set_downstream(t4)
       t3.set_downstream(t5)
       t3.set_downstream(t6)

   Using task-decorated functions aka XComArgs:

   .. code-block:: python

       cross_downstream(from_tasks=[x1(), x2(), x3()], to_tasks=[x4(), x5(), x6()])

   is equivalent to::

       x1.set_downstream(x6)
       x2.set_downstream(x4)
       x2.set_downstream(x5)
       x2.set_downstream(x6)
       x3.set_downstream(x4)
       x3.set_downstream(x5)
       x3.set_downstream(x6)

   It is also possible to mix between classic operator/sensor and XComArg tasks:

   .. code-block:: python

       cross_downstream(from_tasks=[t1, x2(), t3], to_tasks=[x1(), t2, x3()])

   is equivalent to::

       t1 ---> x1
          \ /
       x2 -X -> t2
          / \
       t3 ---> x3

       t3.set_downstream(x1)
       t3.set_downstream(t2)
       t3.set_downstream(x3)

   :param from_tasks: List of tasks or XComArgs to start from.
   :param to_tasks: List of tasks or XComArgs to set as downstream dependencies.


.. py:function:: chain_linear(*elements)

   Simplify task dependency definition.

   E.g.: suppose you want precedence like so::

           ╭─op2─╮ ╭─op4─╮
       op1─┤     ├─├─op5─┤─op7
           ╰-op3─╯ ╰-op6─╯

   Then you can accomplish like so::

       chain_linear(op1, [op2, op3], [op4, op5, op6], op7)

   :param elements: a list of operators / lists of operators
