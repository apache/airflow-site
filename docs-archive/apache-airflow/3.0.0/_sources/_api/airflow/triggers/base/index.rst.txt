.. py:data:: log

.. py:class:: StartTriggerArgs

   Arguments required for start task execution from triggerer.


   .. py:attribute:: trigger_cls
      :type:  str


   .. py:attribute:: next_method
      :type:  str


   .. py:attribute:: trigger_kwargs
      :type:  dict[str, Any] | None
      :value: None

      :type:  dict[str, Any] | None
      :value: None

      :value: None



.. py:class:: BaseTrigger(**kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`abc.ABC`, :py:obj:`airflow.utils.log.logging_mixin.LoggingMixin`


   Base class for all triggers.

   A trigger has two contexts it can exist in:

    - Inside an Operator, when it's passed to TaskDeferred
    - Actively running in a trigger worker

   We use the same class for both situations, and rely on all Trigger classes
   to be able to return the arguments (possible to encode with Airflow-JSON) that will
   let them be re-instantiated elsewhere.


   .. py:attribute:: task_instance
      :value: None



   .. py:attribute:: trigger_id
      :value: None



   .. py:method:: serialize()
      :abstractmethod:


      Return the information needed to reconstruct this Trigger.

      :return: Tuple of (class path, keyword arguments needed to re-instantiate).



   .. py:method:: run()
      :abstractmethod:

      :async:


      Run the trigger in an asynchronous context.

      The trigger should yield an Event whenever it wants to fire off
      an event, and return None if it is finished. Single-event triggers
      should thus yield and then immediately return.

      If it yields, it is likely that it will be resumed very quickly,
      but it may not be (e.g. if the workload is being moved to another
      triggerer process, or a multi-event trigger was being used for a
      single-event task defer).

      In either case, Trigger classes should assume they will be persisted,
      and then rely on cleanup() being called when they are no longer needed.



   .. py:method:: cleanup()
      :async:


      Cleanup the trigger.

      Called when the trigger is no longer needed, and it's being removed
      from the active triggerer process.

      This method follows the async/await pattern to allow to run the cleanup
      in triggerer main event loop. Exceptions raised by the cleanup method
      are ignored, so if you would like to be able to debug them and be notified
      that cleanup method failed, you should wrap your code with try/except block
      and handle it appropriately (in async-compatible way).



   .. py:method:: repr(classpath, kwargs)
      :staticmethod:



   .. py:method:: __repr__()


.. py:class:: BaseEventTrigger(**kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`BaseTrigger`


   Base class for triggers used to schedule DAGs based on external events.

   ``BaseEventTrigger`` is a subclass of ``BaseTrigger`` designed to identify triggers compatible with
   event-driven scheduling.


   .. py:method:: hash(classpath, kwargs)
      :staticmethod:


      Return the hash of the trigger classpath and kwargs. This is used to uniquely identify a trigger.

      We do not want to have this logic in ``BaseTrigger`` because, when used to defer tasks, 2 triggers
      can have the same classpath and kwargs. This is not true for event driven scheduling.



.. py:class:: TriggerEvent(payload, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`pydantic.BaseModel`


   Something that a trigger can fire when its conditions are met.

   Events must have a uniquely identifying value that would be the same
   wherever the trigger is run; this is to ensure that if the same trigger
   is being run in two locations (for HA reasons) that we can deduplicate its
   events.


   .. py:attribute:: payload
      :type:  Any
      :value: None


      The payload for the event to send back to the task.

      Must be natively JSON-serializable, or registered with the airflow serialization code.



   .. py:method:: __repr__()


.. py:class:: TaskSuccessEvent(*, xcoms = None, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`BaseTaskEndEvent`


   Yield this event in order to end the task successfully.


   .. py:attribute:: task_instance_state
      :type:  airflow.utils.state.TaskInstanceState


.. py:class:: TaskFailedEvent(*, xcoms = None, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`BaseTaskEndEvent`


   Yield this event in order to end the task with failure.


   .. py:attribute:: task_instance_state
      :type:  airflow.utils.state.TaskInstanceState


.. py:class:: TaskSkippedEvent(*, xcoms = None, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`BaseTaskEndEvent`


   Yield this event in order to end the task with status 'skipped'.


   .. py:attribute:: task_instance_state
      :type:  airflow.utils.state.TaskInstanceState


.. py:function:: trigger_event_discriminator(v)

.. py:data:: DiscrimatedTriggerEvent
