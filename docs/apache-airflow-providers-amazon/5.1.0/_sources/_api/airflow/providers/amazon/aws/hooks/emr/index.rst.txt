.. py:class:: EmrHook(emr_conn_id = default_conn_name, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.amazon.aws.hooks.base_aws.AwsBaseHook`

   Interact with AWS EMR. emr_conn_id is only necessary for using the
   create_job_flow method.

   Additional arguments (such as ``aws_conn_id``) may be specified and
   are passed down to the underlying AwsBaseHook.

   .. seealso::
       :class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.hooks.base_aws.AwsBaseHook`

   .. py:attribute:: conn_name_attr
      :annotation: = emr_conn_id

      

   .. py:attribute:: default_conn_name
      :annotation: = emr_default

      

   .. py:attribute:: conn_type
      :annotation: = emr

      

   .. py:attribute:: hook_name
      :annotation: = Amazon Elastic MapReduce

      

   .. py:method:: get_cluster_id_by_name(emr_cluster_name, cluster_states)

      Fetch id of EMR cluster with given name and (optional) states.
      Will return only if single id is found.

      :param emr_cluster_name: Name of a cluster to find
      :param cluster_states: State(s) of cluster to find
      :return: id of the EMR cluster


   .. py:method:: create_job_flow(job_flow_overrides)

      Creates a job flow using the config from the EMR connection.
      Keys of the json extra hash may have the arguments of the boto3
      run_job_flow method.
      Overrides for this config may be passed as the job_flow_overrides.



.. py:class:: EmrServerlessHook(*args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.amazon.aws.hooks.base_aws.AwsBaseHook`

   Interact with EMR Serverless API.

   Additional arguments (such as ``aws_conn_id``) may be specified and
   are passed down to the underlying AwsBaseHook.

   .. seealso::
       :class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.hooks.base_aws.AwsBaseHook`

   .. py:method:: conn()

      Get the underlying boto3 EmrServerlessAPIService client (cached)


   .. py:method:: waiter(get_state_callable, get_state_args, parse_response, desired_state, failure_states, object_type, action, countdown = 25 * 60, check_interval_seconds = 60)

      Will run the sensor until it turns True.

      :param get_state_callable: A callable to run until it returns True
      :param get_state_args: Arguments to pass to get_state_callable
      :param parse_response: Dictionary keys to extract state from response of get_state_callable
      :param desired_state: Wait until the getter returns this value
      :param failure_states: A set of states which indicate failure and should throw an
          exception if any are reached before the desired_state
      :param object_type: Used for the reporting string. What are you waiting for? (application, job, etc)
      :param action: Used for the reporting string. What action are you waiting for? (created, deleted, etc)
      :param countdown: Total amount of time the waiter should wait for the desired state
          before timing out (in seconds). Defaults to 25 * 60 seconds.
      :param check_interval_seconds: Number of seconds waiter should wait before attempting
          to retry get_state_callable. Defaults to 60 seconds.


   .. py:method:: get_state(response, keys)



.. py:class:: EmrContainerHook(*args, virtual_cluster_id = None, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.amazon.aws.hooks.base_aws.AwsBaseHook`

   Interact with AWS EMR Virtual Cluster to run, poll jobs and return job status
   Additional arguments (such as ``aws_conn_id``) may be specified and
   are passed down to the underlying AwsBaseHook.

   .. seealso::
       :class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.hooks.base_aws.AwsBaseHook`

   :param virtual_cluster_id: Cluster ID of the EMR on EKS virtual cluster

   .. py:attribute:: INTERMEDIATE_STATES
      :annotation: = ['PENDING', 'SUBMITTED', 'RUNNING']

      

   .. py:attribute:: FAILURE_STATES
      :annotation: = ['FAILED', 'CANCELLED', 'CANCEL_PENDING']

      

   .. py:attribute:: SUCCESS_STATES
      :annotation: = ['COMPLETED']

      

   .. py:attribute:: TERMINAL_STATES
      :annotation: = ['COMPLETED', 'FAILED', 'CANCELLED', 'CANCEL_PENDING']

      

   .. py:method:: create_emr_on_eks_cluster(virtual_cluster_name, eks_cluster_name, eks_namespace, tags = None)


   .. py:method:: submit_job(name, execution_role_arn, release_label, job_driver, configuration_overrides = None, client_request_token = None, tags = None)

      Submit a job to the EMR Containers API and return the job ID.
      A job run is a unit of work, such as a Spark jar, PySpark script,
      or SparkSQL query, that you submit to Amazon EMR on EKS.
      See: https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/emr-containers.html#EMRContainers.Client.start_job_run  # noqa: E501

      :param name: The name of the job run.
      :param execution_role_arn: The IAM role ARN associated with the job run.
      :param release_label: The Amazon EMR release version to use for the job run.
      :param job_driver: Job configuration details, e.g. the Spark job parameters.
      :param configuration_overrides: The configuration overrides for the job run,
          specifically either application configuration or monitoring configuration.
      :param client_request_token: The client idempotency token of the job run request.
          Use this if you want to specify a unique ID to prevent two jobs from getting started.
      :param tags: The tags assigned to job runs.
      :return: Job ID


   .. py:method:: get_job_failure_reason(job_id)

      Fetch the reason for a job failure (e.g. error message). Returns None or reason string.

      :param job_id: Id of submitted job run
      :return: str


   .. py:method:: check_query_status(job_id)

      Fetch the status of submitted job run. Returns None or one of valid query states.
      See: https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/emr-containers.html#EMRContainers.Client.describe_job_run  # noqa: E501
      :param job_id: Id of submitted job run
      :return: str


   .. py:method:: poll_query_status(job_id, max_tries = None, poll_interval = 30)

      Poll the status of submitted job run until query state reaches final state.
      Returns one of the final states.

      :param job_id: Id of submitted job run
      :param max_tries: Number of times to poll for query state before function exits
      :param poll_interval: Time (in seconds) to wait between calls to check query status on EMR
      :return: str


   .. py:method:: stop_query(job_id)

      Cancel the submitted job_run

      :param job_id: Id of submitted job_run
      :return: dict
