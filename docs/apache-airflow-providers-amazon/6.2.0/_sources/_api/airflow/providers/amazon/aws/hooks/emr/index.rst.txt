.. py:class:: EmrHook(emr_conn_id = default_conn_name, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.amazon.aws.hooks.base_aws.AwsBaseHook`

   Interact with Amazon Elastic MapReduce Service.

   :param emr_conn_id: :ref:`Amazon Elastic MapReduce Connection <howto/connection:emr>`.
       This attribute is only necessary when using
       the :meth:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.hooks.emr.EmrHook.create_job_flow` method.

   Additional arguments (such as ``aws_conn_id``) may be specified and
   are passed down to the underlying AwsBaseHook.

   .. seealso::
       :class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.hooks.base_aws.AwsBaseHook`

   .. py:attribute:: conn_name_attr
      :annotation: = emr_conn_id

      

   .. py:attribute:: default_conn_name
      :annotation: = emr_default

      

   .. py:attribute:: conn_type
      :annotation: = emr

      

   .. py:attribute:: hook_name
      :annotation: = Amazon Elastic MapReduce

      

   .. py:method:: get_cluster_id_by_name(emr_cluster_name, cluster_states)

      Fetch id of EMR cluster with given name and (optional) states.
      Will return only if single id is found.

      :param emr_cluster_name: Name of a cluster to find
      :param cluster_states: State(s) of cluster to find
      :return: id of the EMR cluster


   .. py:method:: create_job_flow(job_flow_overrides)

      Create and start running a new cluster (job flow).

      This method uses ``EmrHook.emr_conn_id`` to receive the initial Amazon EMR cluster configuration.
      If ``EmrHook.emr_conn_id`` is empty or the connection does not exist, then an empty initial
      configuration is used.

      :param job_flow_overrides: Is used to overwrite the parameters in the initial Amazon EMR configuration
          cluster. The resulting configuration will be used in the boto3 emr client run_job_flow method.

      .. seealso::
          - :ref:`Amazon Elastic MapReduce Connection <howto/connection:emr>`
          - `API RunJobFlow <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/APIReference/API_RunJobFlow.html>`_
          - `boto3 emr client run_job_flow method <https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/               api/latest/reference/services/emr.html#EMR.Client.run_job_flow>`_.


   .. py:method:: add_job_flow_steps(job_flow_id, steps = None, wait_for_completion = False)

      Add new steps to a running cluster.

      :param job_flow_id: The id of the job flow to which the steps are being added
      :param steps: A list of the steps to be executed by the job flow
      :param wait_for_completion: If True, wait for the steps to be completed. Default is False


   .. py:method:: test_connection()

      Return failed state for test Amazon Elastic MapReduce Connection (untestable).

      We need to overwrite this method because this hook is based on
      :class:`~airflow.providers.amazon.aws.hooks.base_aws.AwsGenericHook`,
      otherwise it will try to test connection to AWS STS by using the default boto3 credential strategy.


   .. py:method:: get_ui_field_behaviour()
      :staticmethod:

      Returns custom UI field behaviour for Amazon Elastic MapReduce Connection.



.. py:class:: EmrServerlessHook(*args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.amazon.aws.hooks.base_aws.AwsBaseHook`

   Interact with EMR Serverless API.

   Additional arguments (such as ``aws_conn_id``) may be specified and
   are passed down to the underlying AwsBaseHook.

   .. py:method:: conn()

      Get the underlying boto3 EmrServerlessAPIService client (cached)


   .. py:method:: waiter(get_state_callable, get_state_args, parse_response, desired_state, failure_states, object_type, action, countdown = 25 * 60, check_interval_seconds = 60)

      Will run the sensor until it turns True.

      :param get_state_callable: A callable to run until it returns True
      :param get_state_args: Arguments to pass to get_state_callable
      :param parse_response: Dictionary keys to extract state from response of get_state_callable
      :param desired_state: Wait until the getter returns this value
      :param failure_states: A set of states which indicate failure and should throw an
          exception if any are reached before the desired_state
      :param object_type: Used for the reporting string. What are you waiting for? (application, job, etc)
      :param action: Used for the reporting string. What action are you waiting for? (created, deleted, etc)
      :param countdown: Total amount of time the waiter should wait for the desired state
          before timing out (in seconds). Defaults to 25 * 60 seconds.
      :param check_interval_seconds: Number of seconds waiter should wait before attempting
          to retry get_state_callable. Defaults to 60 seconds.

.. py:class:: EmrContainerHook(*args, virtual_cluster_id = None, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.amazon.aws.hooks.base_aws.AwsBaseHook`

   Interact with AWS EMR Virtual Cluster to run, poll jobs and return job status
   Additional arguments (such as ``aws_conn_id``) may be specified and
   are passed down to the underlying AwsBaseHook.
