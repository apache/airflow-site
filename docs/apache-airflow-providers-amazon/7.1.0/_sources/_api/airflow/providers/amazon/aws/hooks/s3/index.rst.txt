          When ``keys`` is a string, it's supposed to be the key name of
          the single object to delete.

          When ``keys`` is a list, it's supposed to be the list of the
          keys to delete.

      :param use_autogenerated_subdir: Pairs with 'preserve_file_name = True' to download the file into a
          random generated folder inside the 'local_path', useful to avoid collisions between various tasks
          that might download the same file name. Set it to 'False' if you don't want it, and you want a
