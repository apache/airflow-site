   :param aws_conn_id: The reference to the AWS connection details
   :param gcp_conn_id: The reference to the GCP connection details
   :param vault_name: the Glacier vault on which job is executed
   :param bucket_name: the Google Cloud Storage bucket where the data will be transferred
   :param object_name: the name of the object to check in the Google cloud
