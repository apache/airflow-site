   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.models.BaseOperator`

   Wrap the spark-submit binary to kick off a spark-submit job; requires "spark-submit" binary in the PATH.

       For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
       :ref:`howto/operator:SparkSubmitOperator`

   :param application: The application that submitted as a job, either jar or py file. (templated)
   :param conf: Arbitrary Spark configuration properties (templated)
   :param conn_id: The :ref:`spark connection id <howto/connection:spark>` as configured
       in Airflow administration. When an invalid connection_id is supplied, it will default to yarn.
   :param files: Upload additional files to the executor running the job, separated by a
                 comma. Files will be placed in the working directory of each executor.
                 For example, serialized objects. (templated)
   :param py_files: Additional python files used by the job, can be .zip, .egg or .py. (templated)
   :param jars: Submit additional jars to upload and place them in executor classpath. (templated)
   :param driver_class_path: Additional, driver-specific, classpath settings. (templated)
   :param java_class: the main class of the Java application
   :param packages: Comma-separated list of maven coordinates of jars to include on the
                    driver and executor classpaths. (templated)
   :param exclude_packages: Comma-separated list of maven coordinates of jars to exclude
                            while resolving the dependencies provided in 'packages' (templated)
   :param repositories: Comma-separated list of additional remote repositories to search
                        for the maven coordinates given with 'packages'
   :param total_executor_cores: (Standalone & Mesos only) Total cores for all executors
                                (Default: all the available cores on the worker)
   :param executor_cores: (Standalone & YARN only) Number of cores per executor (Default: 2)
   :param executor_memory: Memory per executor (e.g. 1000M, 2G) (Default: 1G)
   :param driver_memory: Memory allocated to the driver (e.g. 1000M, 2G) (Default: 1G)
   :param keytab: Full path to the file that contains the keytab (templated)
   :param principal: The name of the kerberos principal used for keytab (templated)
   :param proxy_user: User to impersonate when submitting the application (templated)
   :param name: Name of the job (default airflow-spark). (templated)
   :param num_executors: Number of executors to launch
   :param status_poll_interval: Seconds to wait between polls of driver status in cluster
       mode (Default: 1)
   :param application_args: Arguments for the application being submitted (templated)
   :param env_vars: Environment variables for spark-submit. It supports yarn and k8s mode too. (templated)
   :param verbose: Whether to pass the verbose flag to spark-submit process for debugging
   :param spark_binary: The command to use for spark submit.
                        Some distros may use spark2-submit or spark3-submit.
                        (will overwrite any spark_binary defined in the connection's extra JSON)
   :param properties_file: Path to a file from which to load extra properties. If not
                             specified, this will look for conf/spark-defaults.conf.
   :param queue: The name of the YARN queue to which the application is submitted.
                       (will overwrite any yarn queue defined in the connection's extra JSON)
   :param deploy_mode: Whether to deploy your driver on the worker nodes (cluster) or locally as a client.
                       (will overwrite any deployment mode defined in the connection's extra JSON)
   :param use_krb5ccache: if True, configure spark to use ticket cache instead of relying
                          on keytab for Kerberos login

   .. py:method:: execute(context)

      Call the SparkSubmitHook to run the provided spark job.


   .. py:method:: on_kill()

      Override this method to clean up subprocesses when a task instance gets killed.

      Any use of the threading, subprocess or multiprocessing module within an
      operator needs to be cleaned up, or it will leave ghost processes behind.
