.. py:class:: AttributeList(_list)


   Helper class to provide attribute like access to List objects.

   .. py:method:: __getitem__(k)


   .. py:method:: __iter__()


   .. py:method:: __bool__()



.. py:class:: AttributeDict(d)


   Helper class to provide attribute like access to Dictionary objects.

   .. py:method:: __getattr__(attr_name)


   .. py:method:: __getitem__(key)


   .. py:method:: to_dict()



.. py:class:: Hit(document)


   Bases: :py:obj:`AttributeDict`

   The Hit class is used to manage and access elements in a document.

   It inherits from the AttributeDict class and provides
   attribute-like access to its elements, similar to a dictionary.


.. py:class:: HitMeta(document, exclude=('_source', '_fields'))


   Bases: :py:obj:`AttributeDict`

   The HitMeta class is used to manage and access metadata of a document.

   This class inherits from the AttributeDict class and provides
   attribute-like access to its elements.


.. py:class:: ElasticSearchResponse(search, response, doc_class=None)


   Bases: :py:obj:`AttributeDict`

   The ElasticSearchResponse class is used to manage and access the response from an Elasticsearch search.

   This class can be iterated over directly to access hits in the response. Indexing the class instance
   with an integer or slice will also access the hits. The class also evaluates to True
   if there are any hits in the response.

   The hits property returns an AttributeList of hits in the response, with each hit transformed into
   an instance of the doc_class if provided.

   The response parameter stores the dictionary returned by the Elasticsearch client search method.

   .. py:property:: hits
      :type: list[Hit]

      This property provides access to the hits (i.e., the results) of the Elasticsearch response.

      The hits are represented as an `AttributeList` of `Hit` instances, which allow for easy,
      attribute-like access to the hit data.

      The hits are lazily loaded, meaning they're not processed until this property is accessed.
      Upon first access, the hits data from the response is processed using the `_get_result` method
      of the associated `Search` instance (i.e. an instance from ElasticsearchTaskHandler class),
      and the results are stored for future accesses.

      Each hit also includes all the additional data present in the "hits" field of the response,
      accessible as attributes of the hit.
