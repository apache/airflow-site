   Fetches all the Alert Policies identified by the filter passed as
   filter parameter. The desired return type can be specified by the
   format parameter, the supported formats are "dict", "json" and None
   which returns python dictionary, stringified JSON and protobuf
   respectively.

   .. seealso::
       For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
       :ref:`howto/operator:StackdriverListAlertPoliciesOperator`

   :param format_: (Optional) Desired output format of the result. The
       supported formats are "dict", "json" and None which returns
       python dictionary, stringified JSON and protobuf respectively.
   :param filter_:  If provided, this field specifies the criteria that must be met by alert
       policies to be included in the response.
       For more details, see https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/sorting-and-filtering.
   :param order_by: A comma-separated list of fields by which to sort the result.
       Supports the same set of field references as the ``filter`` field. Entries
       can be prefixed with a minus sign to sort by the field in descending order.
       For more details, see https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/sorting-and-filtering.
   :param page_size: The maximum number of resources contained in the
       underlying API response. If page streaming is performed per-
       resource, this parameter does not affect the return value. If page
       streaming is performed per-page, this determines the maximum number
       of resources in a page.
   :param retry: A retry object used to retry requests. If ``None`` is
       specified, requests will be retried using a default configuration.
   :param timeout: The amount of time, in seconds, to wait
       for the request to complete. Note that if ``retry`` is
       specified, the timeout applies to each individual attempt.
   :param metadata: Additional metadata that is provided to the method.
   :param gcp_conn_id: (Optional) The connection ID used to connect to Google
       Cloud Platform.
   :param project_id: The project to fetch alerts from.

       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
       of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).

   :param name: The alerting policy to delete. The format is:
                    ``projects/[PROJECT_ID]/notificationChannels/[CHANNEL_ID]``.
   :param retry: A retry object used to retry requests. If ``None`` is
       specified, requests will be retried using a default configuration.
   :param timeout: The amount of time, in seconds, to wait
       for the request to complete. Note that if ``retry`` is
       specified, the timeout applies to each individual attempt.
   :param metadata: Additional metadata that is provided to the method.
   :param gcp_conn_id: (Optional) The connection ID used to connect to Google
       Cloud Platform.
   :param project_id: The project from which notification channel needs to be deleted.
   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
       of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).
