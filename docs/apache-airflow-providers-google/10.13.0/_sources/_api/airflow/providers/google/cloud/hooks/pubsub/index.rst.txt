      Creates a Pub/Sub subscription, if it does not already exist.

      :param topic: the Pub/Sub topic name that the subscription will be bound
          to create; do not include the ``projects/{project}/subscriptions/`` prefix.
      :param project_id: Optional, the Google Cloud project ID of the topic that the subscription will be
          bound to. If set to None or missing, the default project_id from the Google Cloud connection
          is used.
      :param subscription: the Pub/Sub subscription name. If empty, a random
          name will be generated using the uuid module
      :param subscription_project_id: the Google Cloud project ID where the subscription
          will be created. If unspecified, ``project_id`` will be used.
      :param ack_deadline_secs: Number of seconds that a subscriber has to
          acknowledge each message pulled from the subscription
      :param fail_if_exists: if set, raise an exception if the topic
          already exists
      :param push_config: If push delivery is used with this subscription,
          this field is used to configure it. An empty ``pushConfig`` signifies
          that the subscriber will pull and ack messages using API methods.
      :param retain_acked_messages: Indicates whether to retain acknowledged
          messages. If true, then messages are not expunged from the subscription's
          backlog, even if they are acknowledged, until they fall out of the
          ``message_retention_duration`` window. This must be true if you would
          like to Seek to a timestamp.
      :param message_retention_duration: How long to retain unacknowledged messages
          in the subscription's backlog, from the moment a message is published. If
          ``retain_acked_messages`` is true, then this also configures the
          retention of acknowledged messages, and thus configures how far back in
          time a ``Seek`` can be done. Defaults to 7 days. Cannot be more than 7
          days or less than 10 minutes.
      :param labels: Client-assigned labels; see
          https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/labels
      :param enable_message_ordering: If true, messages published with the same
          ordering_key in PubsubMessage will be delivered to the subscribers in the order
          in which they are received by the Pub/Sub system. Otherwise, they may be
          delivered in any order.
      :param expiration_policy: A policy that specifies the conditions for this
          subscription's expiration. A subscription is considered active as long as any
          connected subscriber is successfully consuming messages from the subscription or
          is issuing operations on the subscription. If expiration_policy is not set,
          a default policy with ttl of 31 days will be used. The minimum allowed value for
          expiration_policy.ttl is 1 day.
      :param filter_: An expression written in the Cloud Pub/Sub filter language. If
          non-empty, then only PubsubMessages whose attributes field matches the filter are
          delivered on this subscription. If empty, then no messages are filtered out.
      :param dead_letter_policy: A policy that specifies the conditions for dead lettering
          messages in this subscription. If dead_letter_policy is not set, dead lettering is
          disabled.
      :param retry_policy: A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries message delivery
          for this subscription. If not set, the default retry policy is applied. This
          generally implies that messages will be retried as soon as possible for healthy
          subscribers. RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs or acknowledgement deadline
          exceeded events for a given message.
      :param retry: (Optional) A retry object used to retry requests.
          If None is specified, requests will not be retried.
      :param timeout: (Optional) The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the request
          to complete. Note that if retry is specified, the timeout applies to each
          individual attempt.
      :param metadata: (Optional) Additional metadata that is provided to the method.
      :return: subscription name which will be the system-generated value if
          the ``subscription`` parameter is not supplied
