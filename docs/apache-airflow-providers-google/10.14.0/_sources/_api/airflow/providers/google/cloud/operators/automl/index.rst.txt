   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.cloud_base.GoogleCloudBaseOperator`

   Lists table specs in a dataset.

       For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
       :ref:`howto/operator:AutoMLTablesListTableSpecsOperator`

   :param dataset_id: Name of the dataset.
   :param filter_: Filter expression, see go/filtering.
   :param page_size: The maximum number of resources contained in the
       underlying API response. If page streaming is performed per
       resource, this parameter does not affect the return value. If page
       streaming is performed per-page, this determines the maximum number
       of resources in a page.
   :param project_id: ID of the Google Cloud project if None then
       default project_id is used.
   :param location: The location of the project.
   :param retry: A retry object used to retry requests. If `None` is specified, requests will not be
       retried.
   :param timeout: The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the request to complete. Note that if
       `retry` is specified, the timeout applies to each individual attempt.
   :param metadata: Additional metadata that is provided to the method.
   :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use to connect to Google Cloud.
   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
       of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).
