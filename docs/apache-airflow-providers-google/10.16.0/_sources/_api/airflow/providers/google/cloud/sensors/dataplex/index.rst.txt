   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.sensors.base.BaseSensorOperator`

   Check the status of the Dataplex task.

   :param project_id: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud project that the task belongs to.
   :param region: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud region that the task belongs to.
   :param lake_id: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud lake that the task belongs to.
   :param dataplex_task_id: Required. Task identifier.
   :param api_version: The version of the api that will be requested for example 'v3'.
   :param retry: A retry object used  to retry requests. If `None` is specified, requests
       will not be retried.
   :param metadata: Additional metadata that is provided to the method.
   :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use when fetching connection info.
   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
       of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).

   .. py:attribute:: template_fields
      :value: ['dataplex_task_id']

      

   .. py:method:: poke(context)

      Override when deriving this class.

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.sensors.base.BaseSensorOperator`

   Check the status of the Dataplex DataQuality job.

   :param project_id: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud project that the task belongs to.
   :param region: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud region that the task belongs to.
   :param data_scan_id: Required. Data Quality scan identifier.
   :param job_id: Required. Job ID.
   :param api_version: The version of the api that will be requested for example 'v3'.
   :param retry: A retry object used  to retry requests. If `None` is specified, requests
       will not be retried.
   :param metadata: Additional metadata that is provided to the method.
   :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use when fetching connection info.

       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
       of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).
   :param result_timeout: Value in seconds for which operator will wait for the Data Quality scan result.
       Throws exception if there is no result found after specified amount of seconds.
   :param fail_on_dq_failure: If set to true and not all Data Quality scan rules have been passed,
       an exception is thrown. If set to false and not all Data Quality scan rules have been passed,
       execution will finish with success.

   :return: Boolean indicating if the job run has reached the ``DataScanJob.State.SUCCEEDED``.
