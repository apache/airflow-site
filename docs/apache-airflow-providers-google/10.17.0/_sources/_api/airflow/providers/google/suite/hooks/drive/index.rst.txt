   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.google.common.hooks.base_google.GoogleBaseHook`

   Hook for the Google Drive APIs.

   :param api_version: API version used (for example v3).
   :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use when fetching connection info.
   :param delegate_to: The account to impersonate using domain-wide delegation of authority,
       if any. For this to work, the service account making the request must have
       domain-wide delegation enabled.
   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token

       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account.

      :param resumable: True if this is a resumable upload. False means upload
          in a single request.
      :param folder_id: The base/root folder id for remote_location (part of the drive URL of a folder).
