.. py:class:: WorkflowsHook(**kwargs)


   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.google.common.hooks.base_google.GoogleBaseHook`

   Hook for Google GCP APIs.

   All the methods in the hook where project_id is used must be called with
   keyword arguments rather than positional.

   .. py:method:: get_workflows_client()

      Returns WorkflowsClient.


   .. py:method:: get_executions_client()

      Returns ExecutionsClient.


   .. py:method:: create_workflow(workflow, workflow_id, location, project_id = PROVIDE_PROJECT_ID, retry = DEFAULT, timeout = None, metadata = ())

      Creates a new workflow. If a workflow with the specified name
      already exists in the specified project and location, the long
      running operation will return
      [ALREADY_EXISTS][google.rpc.Code.ALREADY_EXISTS] error.

      :param workflow: Required. Workflow to be created.
      :param workflow_id: Required. The ID of the workflow to be created.
      :param project_id: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud project the cluster belongs to.
      :param location: Required. The GCP region in which to handle the request.
      :param retry: A retry object used to retry requests. If ``None`` is specified, requests will not be
          retried.
      :param timeout: The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the request to complete. Note that if
          ``retry`` is specified, the timeout applies to each individual attempt.
      :param metadata: Additional metadata that is provided to the method.


   .. py:method:: get_workflow(workflow_id, location, project_id = PROVIDE_PROJECT_ID, retry = DEFAULT, timeout = None, metadata = ())

      Gets details of a single Workflow.

      :param workflow_id: Required. The ID of the workflow to be created.
      :param project_id: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud project the cluster belongs to.
      :param location: Required. The GCP region in which to handle the request.
      :param retry: A retry object used to retry requests. If ``None`` is specified, requests will not be

          ``retry`` is specified, the timeout applies to each individual attempt.
      :param metadata: Additional metadata that is provided to the method.


   .. py:method:: update_workflow(workflow, update_mask = None, retry = DEFAULT, timeout = None, metadata = ())

      Updates an existing workflow.
      Running this method has no impact on already running
      executions of the workflow. A new revision of the
      workflow may be created as a result of a successful
      update operation. In that case, such revision will be
      used in new workflow executions.

      :param workflow: Required. Workflow to be created.
      :param update_mask: List of fields to be updated. If not present,
          the entire workflow will be updated.
      :param retry: A retry object used to retry requests. If ``None`` is specified, requests will not be
          retried.
      :param timeout: The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the request to complete. Note that if
          ``retry`` is specified, the timeout applies to each individual attempt.
      :param metadata: Additional metadata that is provided to the method.


   .. py:method:: delete_workflow(workflow_id, location, project_id = PROVIDE_PROJECT_ID, retry = DEFAULT, timeout = None, metadata = ())

      Deletes a workflow with the specified name.
      This method also cancels and deletes all running
      executions of the workflow.

      :param workflow_id: Required. The ID of the workflow to be created.
      :param project_id: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud project the cluster belongs to.
      :param location: Required. The GCP region in which to handle the request.
      :param retry: A retry object used to retry requests. If ``None`` is specified, requests will not be
          retried.
      :param timeout: The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the request to complete. Note that if
          ``retry`` is specified, the timeout applies to each individual attempt.
      :param metadata: Additional metadata that is provided to the method.


   .. py:method:: list_workflows(location, project_id = PROVIDE_PROJECT_ID, filter_ = None, order_by = None, retry = DEFAULT, timeout = None, metadata = ())

      Lists Workflows in a given project and location.
      The default order is not specified.

      :param filter_: Filter to restrict results to specific workflows.
      :param order_by: Comma-separated list of fields that
          specifies the order of the results. Default sorting order for a field is ascending.
          To specify descending order for a field, append a "desc" suffix.
          If not specified, the results will be returned in an unspecified order.
      :param project_id: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud project the cluster belongs to.
      :param location: Required. The GCP region in which to handle the request.
