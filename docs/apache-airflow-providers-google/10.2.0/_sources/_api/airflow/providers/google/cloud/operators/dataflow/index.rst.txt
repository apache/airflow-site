   Helper enum for choosing what to do if job is already running.

   IgnoreJob - do not check if running
   FinishIfRunning - finish current dag run with no action
   WaitForRun - wait for job to finish and then continue with new job

   Dataflow configuration that can be passed to
   :class:`~airflow.providers.apache.beam.operators.beam.BeamRunJavaPipelineOperator` and
   :class:`~airflow.providers.apache.beam.operators.beam.BeamRunPythonPipelineOperator`.

   :param job_name: The 'jobName' to use when executing the Dataflow job
       (templated). This ends up being set in the pipeline options, so any entry
       with key ``'jobName'`` or  ``'job_name'``in ``options`` will be overwritten.
   :param append_job_name: True if unique suffix has to be appended to job name.
   :param project_id: Optional, the Google Cloud project ID in which to start a job.
       If set to None or missing, the default project_id from the Google Cloud connection is used.
   :param location: Job location.
   :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use connecting to Google Cloud.
   :param poll_sleep: The time in seconds to sleep between polling Google
       Cloud Platform for the dataflow job status while the job is in the
       JOB_STATE_RUNNING state.
   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
       of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).

       .. warning::
           This option requires Apache Beam 2.39.0 or newer.

   :param drain_pipeline: Optional, set to True if want to stop streaming job by draining it
       instead of canceling during killing task instance. See:
       https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/stopping-a-pipeline
   :param cancel_timeout: How long (in seconds) operator should wait for the pipeline to be
       successfully cancelled when task is being killed. (optional) default to 300s
   :param wait_until_finished: (Optional)
       If True, wait for the end of pipeline execution before exiting.
       If False, only submits job.
       If None, default behavior.

       The default behavior depends on the type of pipeline:

       * for the streaming pipeline, wait for jobs to start,
       * for the batch pipeline, wait for the jobs to complete.

       .. warning::
           You cannot call ``PipelineResult.wait_until_finish`` method in your pipeline code for the operator
           to work properly. i. e. you must use asynchronous execution. Otherwise, your pipeline will
           always wait until finished. For more information, look at:
           `Asynchronous execution
           <https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/specifying-exec-params#python_10>`__

       The process of starting the Dataflow job in Airflow consists of two steps:
       * running a subprocess and reading the stderr/stderr log for the job id.
       * loop waiting for the end of the job ID from the previous step by checking its status.

       Step two is started just after step one has finished, so if you have wait_until_finished in your
       pipeline code, step two will not start until the process stops. When this process stops,
       steps two will run, but it will only execute one iteration as the job will be in a terminal state.

       If you in your pipeline do not call the wait_for_pipeline method but pass wait_until_finish=True
       to the operator, the second loop will wait for the job's terminal state.

       If you in your pipeline do not call the wait_for_pipeline method, and pass wait_until_finish=False
       to the operator, the second loop will check once is job not in terminal state and exit the loop.
   :param multiple_jobs: If pipeline creates multiple jobs then monitor all jobs. Supported only by
       :class:`~airflow.providers.apache.beam.operators.beam.BeamRunJavaPipelineOperator`.
   :param check_if_running: Before running job, validate that a previous run is not in process.
       Supported only by:
       :class:`~airflow.providers.apache.beam.operators.beam.BeamRunJavaPipelineOperator`.
   :param service_account: Run the job as a specific service account, instead of the default GCE robot.

       https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/pipelines/specifying-exec-params

   .. seealso::
       For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
       :ref:`howto/operator:DataflowCreateJavaJobOperator`

   :param jar: The reference to a self executing Dataflow jar (templated).
   :param job_name: The 'jobName' to use when executing the Dataflow job
       (templated). This ends up being set in the pipeline options, so any entry
       with key ``'jobName'`` in ``options`` will be overwritten.
   :param dataflow_default_options: Map of default job options.
   :param options: Map of job specific options.The key must be a dictionary.

       The value can contain different types:

       * If the value is None, the single option - ``--key`` (without value) will be added.
       * If the value is False, this option will be skipped
       * If the value is True, the single option - ``--key`` (without value) will be added.
       * If the value is list, the many options will be added for each key.
         If the value is ``['A', 'B']`` and the key is ``key`` then the ``--key=A --key=B`` options
         will be left
       * Other value types will be replaced with the Python textual representation.

       When defining labels (``labels`` option), you can also provide a dictionary.

   :param project_id: Optional, the Google Cloud project ID in which to start a job.
       If set to None or missing, the default project_id from the Google Cloud connection is used.
   :param location: Job location.
   :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use connecting to Google Cloud.
   :param poll_sleep: The time in seconds to sleep between polling Google
       Cloud Platform for the dataflow job status while the job is in the
       JOB_STATE_RUNNING state.
   :param job_class: The name of the dataflow job class to be executed, it
       is often not the main class configured in the dataflow jar file.

   :param multiple_jobs: If pipeline creates multiple jobs then monitor all jobs
   :param check_if_running: before running job, validate that a previous run is not in process
       if job is running finish with nothing, WaitForRun= wait until job finished and the run job)
       ``jar``, ``options``, and ``job_name`` are templated so you can use variables in them.
   :param cancel_timeout: How long (in seconds) operator should wait for the pipeline to be
       successfully cancelled when task is being killed.
   :param wait_until_finished: (Optional)
       If True, wait for the end of pipeline execution before exiting.
       If False, only submits job.
       If None, default behavior.

       The default behavior depends on the type of pipeline:

       * for the streaming pipeline, wait for jobs to start,
       * for the batch pipeline, wait for the jobs to complete.

       .. warning::

           You cannot call ``PipelineResult.wait_until_finish`` method in your pipeline code for the operator
           to work properly. i. e. you must use asynchronous execution. Otherwise, your pipeline will
           always wait until finished. For more information, look at:
           `Asynchronous execution
           <https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/specifying-exec-params#python_10>`__

       The process of starting the Dataflow job in Airflow consists of two steps:

       * running a subprocess and reading the stderr/stderr log for the job id.
       * loop waiting for the end of the job ID from the previous step.
         This loop checks the status of the job.

       Step two is started just after step one has finished, so if you have wait_until_finished in your
       pipeline code, step two will not start until the process stops. When this process stops,
       steps two will run, but it will only execute one iteration as the job will be in a terminal state.

       If you in your pipeline do not call the wait_for_pipeline method but pass wait_until_finish=True
       to the operator, the second loop will wait for the job's terminal state.

       If you in your pipeline do not call the wait_for_pipeline method, and pass wait_until_finish=False
       to the operator, the second loop will check once is job not in terminal state and exit the loop.

   Note that both
   ``dataflow_default_options`` and ``options`` will be merged to specify pipeline
   execution parameter, and ``dataflow_default_options`` is expected to save
   high-level options, for instances, project and zone information, which
   apply to all dataflow operators in the DAG.

   It's a good practice to define dataflow_* parameters in the default_args of the dag
   like the project, zone and staging location.

   .. code-block:: python

      default_args = {
          "dataflow_default_options": {
              "zone": "europe-west1-d",
              "stagingLocation": "gs://my-staging-bucket/staging/",
          }
      }

   You need to pass the path to your dataflow as a file reference with the ``jar``
   parameter, the jar needs to be a self executing jar (see documentation here:
   https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/dataflow/#self-executing-jar).
   Use ``options`` to pass on options to your job.

   .. code-block:: python

      t1 = DataflowCreateJavaJobOperator(
          task_id="dataflow_example",
          jar="{{var.value.gcp_dataflow_base}}pipeline/build/libs/pipeline-example-1.0.jar",

      Override this method to clean up subprocesses when a task instance

      module within an operator needs to be cleaned up, or it will leave
      ghost processes behind.

   You need to pass the path to your dataflow template as a file reference with the

   Use ``environment`` to pass on runtime environment variables to your job.

   .. code-block:: python

          task_id="dataflow_example",
          template="{{var.value.gcp_dataflow_base}}",

          dag=my_dag,
      )

   ``template``, ``dataflow_default_options``, ``parameters``, and ``job_name`` are
   templated, so you can use variables in them.

   Note that ``dataflow_default_options`` is expected to save high-level options
   for project information, which apply to all dataflow operators in the DAG.

           always wait until finished. For more information, look at:
           `Asynchronous execution
           <https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/specifying-exec-params#python_10>`__

       The process of starting the Dataflow job in Airflow consists of two steps:

       * running a subprocess and reading the stderr/stderr log for the job id.
       * loop waiting for the end of the job ID from the previous step.
         This loop checks the status of the job.

       Step two is started just after step one has finished, so if you have wait_until_finished in your
       pipeline code, step two will not start until the process stops. When this process stops,
       steps two will run, but it will only execute one iteration as the job will be in a terminal state.

       If you in your pipeline do not call the wait_for_pipeline method but pass wait_until_finish=True
       to the operator, the second loop will wait for the job's terminal state.

       If you in your pipeline do not call the wait_for_pipeline method, and pass wait_until_finish=False
       to the operator, the second loop will check once is job not in terminal state and exit the loop.
