   .. py:method:: list_alert_policies(project_id = PROVIDE_PROJECT_ID, format_ = None, filter_ = None, order_by = None, page_size = None, retry = DEFAULT, timeout = None, metadata = ())

      Fetch all the Alert Policies identified by the filter passed as filter parameter.

      The desired return type can be specified by the format parameter, the supported formats
      are "dict", "json" and None which returns python dictionary, stringified JSON and protobuf
      respectively.

      :param format_: (Optional) Desired output format of the result. The
          supported formats are "dict", "json" and None which returns
          python dictionary, stringified JSON and protobuf respectively.
      :param filter_:  If provided, this field specifies the criteria that
          must be met by alert policies to be included in the response.
          For more details, see https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/sorting-and-filtering.
      :param order_by: A comma-separated list of fields by which to sort the result.
          Supports the same set of field references as the ``filter`` field. Entries
          can be prefixed with a minus sign to sort by the field in descending order.
          For more details, see https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/sorting-and-filtering.
      :param page_size: The maximum number of resources contained in the
          underlying API response. If page streaming is performed per-
          resource, this parameter does not affect the return value. If page
          streaming is performed per-page, this determines the maximum number
          of resources in a page.
      :param retry: A retry object used to retry requests. If ``None`` is
          specified, requests will be retried using a default configuration.

          for the request to complete. Note that if ``retry`` is
          specified, the timeout applies to each individual attempt.
      :param metadata: Additional metadata that is provided to the method.
      :param project_id: The project to fetch alerts from.
