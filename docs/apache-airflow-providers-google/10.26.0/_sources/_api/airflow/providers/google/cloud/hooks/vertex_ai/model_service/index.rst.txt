      :staticmethod:

      Return unique id of the model.


   .. py:method:: wait_for_operation(operation, timeout = None)

      Wait for long-lasting operation to complete.


   .. py:method:: delete_model(project_id, region, model, retry = DEFAULT, timeout = None, metadata = ())

      :param region: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud region that the service belongs to.
      :param model: Required. The name of the Model resource to be deleted.
      :param retry: Designation of what errors, if any, should be retried.
      :param timeout: The timeout for this request.

          -  ``display_name`` supports = and !=
          -  ``labels`` supports general map functions that is:
          --  ``labels.key=value`` - key:value equality
          --  \`labels.key:\* or labels:key - key existence
          --  A key including a space must be quoted. ``labels."a key"``.
