   .. py:method:: cancel_pipeline_job(project_id, region, pipeline_job, retry = DEFAULT, timeout = None, metadata = ())

      Cancels a PipelineJob.

      Starts asynchronous cancellation on the PipelineJob. The server makes a best
      effort to cancel the pipeline, but success is not guaranteed. Clients can use
      [PipelineService.GetPipelineJob][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.PipelineService.GetPipelineJob] or other
      methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the pipeline completed despite
      cancellation. On successful cancellation, the PipelineJob is not deleted; instead it becomes a
      pipeline with a [PipelineJob.error][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.PipelineJob.error] value with a
      [google.rpc.Status.code][google.rpc.Status.code] of 1, corresponding to ``Code.CANCELLED``, and
      [PipelineJob.state][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.PipelineJob.state] is set to ``CANCELLED``.

      :param model_serving_container_command: The command with which the container is run. Not executed
          within a shell. The Docker image's ENTRYPOINT is used if this is not provided.
          Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's
          environment. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the
          input string will be unchanged. The $(VAR_NAME) syntax can be escaped

          field is primarily informational, it gives Vertex AI information about the
          network connections the container uses. Listing or not a port here has
          no impact on whether the port is actually exposed, any port listening on
          the default "0.0.0.0" address inside a container will be accessible from
          the network.

             ``<=``, and ``>=`` comparisons. Values must be in RFC
             3339 format.
          -  ``labels``: Supports key-value equality and key presence.

          Filter expressions can be combined together using logical
          operators (``AND`` & ``OR``). For example:
          ``pipeline_name="test" AND create_time>"2020-05-18T13:30:00Z"``.

          The syntax to define filter expression is based on
          https://google.aip.dev/160.
      :param page_size: Optional. The standard list page size.
      :param page_token: Optional. The standard list page token. Typically obtained via
          [ListPipelineJobsResponse.next_page_token][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.ListPipelineJobsResponse.next_page_token]
          of the previous
          [PipelineService.ListPipelineJobs][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.PipelineService.ListPipelineJobs]
          call.
      :param order_by: Optional. A comma-separated list of fields to order by. The default
          sort order is in ascending order. Use "desc" after a field
          name for descending. You can have multiple order_by fields
          provided e.g. "create_time desc, end_time", "end_time,
          start_time, update_time" For example, using "create_time
          desc, end_time" will order results by create time in
          descending order, and if there are multiple jobs having the
          same create time, order them by the end time in ascending
          order. if order_by is not specified, it will order by
          default order is create time in descending order. Supported
          fields:

          -  ``create_time``
          -  ``update_time``
          -  ``end_time``
          -  ``start_time``
      :param retry: Designation of what errors, if any, should be retried.
      :param timeout: The timeout for this request.
      :param metadata: Strings which should be sent along with the request as metadata.
