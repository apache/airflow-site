.. py:class:: TransferJobPreprocessor(body, aws_conn_id = 'aws_default', default_schedule = False)


   Helper class for preprocess of transfer job body.

   .. py:method:: process_body()

      Injects AWS credentials into body if needed and reformats schedule information.

      :return: Preprocessed body



.. py:class:: TransferJobValidator(body)


   Helper class for validating transfer job body.

   .. py:method:: validate_body()

      Validates the body.

      Checks if body specifies `transferSpec` if yes, then check if AWS credentials
      are passed correctly and no more than 1 data source was selected.

      :raises: AirflowException



.. py:class:: CloudDataTransferServiceCreateJobOperator(*, body, aws_conn_id = 'aws_default', gcp_conn_id = 'google_cloud_default', api_version = 'v1', project_id = None, google_impersonation_chain = None, **kwargs)


   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.cloud_base.GoogleCloudBaseOperator`

   Creates a transfer job that runs periodically.

   .. warning::

       This operator is NOT idempotent in the following cases:

       * `name` is not passed in body param
       * transfer job `name` has been soft deleted. In this case,
         each new task will receive a unique suffix

       If you run it many times, many transfer jobs will be created in the Google Cloud.

   .. seealso::
       For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
       :ref:`howto/operator:CloudDataTransferServiceCreateJobOperator`

       Amazon Web Service.
   :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID used to connect to Google Cloud.

       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).
