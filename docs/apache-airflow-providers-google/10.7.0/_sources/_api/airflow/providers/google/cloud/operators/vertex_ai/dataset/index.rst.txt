   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.cloud_base.GoogleCloudBaseOperator`

   Creates a Dataset.

   :param project_id: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud project the cluster belongs to.
   :param region: Required. The Cloud Dataproc region in which to handle the request.
   :param dataset:  Required. The Dataset to create. This corresponds to the ``dataset`` field on the
       ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this should not be set.
   :param retry: Designation of what errors, if any, should be retried.
   :param timeout: The timeout for this request.
   :param metadata: Strings which should be sent along with the request as metadata.
   :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use connecting to Google Cloud.
   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
       of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).
