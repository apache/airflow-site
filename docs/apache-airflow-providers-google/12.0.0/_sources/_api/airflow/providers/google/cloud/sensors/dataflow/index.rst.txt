   Checks for the status of a job in Google Cloud Dataflow.

   .. seealso::
       For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
       :ref:`howto/operator:DataflowJobStatusSensor`

   :param job_id: ID of the job to be checked.
   :param expected_statuses: The expected state(s) of the operation.
       See:
       https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/reference/rest/v1b3/projects.jobs#Job.JobState
   :param project_id: Optional, the Google Cloud project ID in which to start a job.
       If set to None or missing, the default project_id from the Google Cloud connection is used.
   :param location: The location of the Dataflow job (for example europe-west1). See:
       https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/regional-endpoints
   :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use connecting to Google Cloud.
   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
       of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).
   :param deferrable: If True, run the sensor in the deferrable mode.
   :param poll_interval: Time (seconds) to wait between two consecutive calls to check the job.

      Airflow runs this method on the worker and defers using the trigger.


   .. py:method:: execute_complete(context, event)

      Execute this method when the task resumes its execution on the worker after deferral.
