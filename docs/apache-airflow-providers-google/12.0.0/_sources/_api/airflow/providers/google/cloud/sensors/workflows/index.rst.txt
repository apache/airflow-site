   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.sensors.base.BaseSensorOperator`

   Checks state of an execution for the given ``workflow_id`` and ``execution_id``.

   :param workflow_id: Required. The ID of the workflow.
   :param execution_id: Required. The ID of the execution.
   :param project_id: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud project the cluster belongs to.
   :param location: Required. The Cloud Dataproc region in which to handle the request.
   :param success_states: Execution states to be considered as successful, by default
       it's only ``SUCCEEDED`` state
   :param failure_states: Execution states to be considered as failures, by default
       they are ``FAILED`` and ``CANCELLED`` states.
   :param retry: A retry object used to retry requests. If ``None`` is specified, requests will not be
       retried.
   :param request_timeout: The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the request to complete. Note that if
       ``retry`` is specified, the timeout applies to each individual attempt.
   :param metadata: Additional metadata that is provided to the method.

      :value: ('location', 'workflow_id', 'execution_id')
