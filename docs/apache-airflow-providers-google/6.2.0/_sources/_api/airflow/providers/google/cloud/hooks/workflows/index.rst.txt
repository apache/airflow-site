.. py:class:: WorkflowsHook

   Bases: :class:`airflow.providers.google.common.hooks.base_google.GoogleBaseHook`

   Hook for Google GCP APIs.

   All the methods in the hook where project_id is used must be called with
   keyword arguments rather than positional.

   
   .. method:: get_workflows_client(self)

      Returns WorkflowsClient.



   
   .. method:: get_executions_client(self)

      Returns ExecutionsClient.

      Creates a new workflow. If a workflow with the specified name
      already exists in the specified project and location, the long
      running operation will return
      [ALREADY_EXISTS][google.rpc.Code.ALREADY_EXISTS] error.
