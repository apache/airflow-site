   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.google.common.hooks.base_google.GoogleBaseHook`

   Hook for Google GCP APIs.

   All the methods in the hook where project_id is used must be called with
   keyword arguments rather than positional.

      Creates a new workflow. If a workflow with the specified name
      already exists in the specified project and location, the long
      running operation will return
      [ALREADY_EXISTS][google.rpc.Code.ALREADY_EXISTS] error.
