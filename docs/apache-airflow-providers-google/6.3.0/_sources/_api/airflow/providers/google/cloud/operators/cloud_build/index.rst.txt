.. py:class:: BuildProcessor(build: Union[Dict, google.cloud.devtools.cloudbuild_v1.types.Build])

   Processes build configurations to add additional functionality to support the use of operators.
   The following improvements are made:
   * It is required to provide the source and only one type can be given,
   * It is possible to provide the source as the URL address instead dict.

   :param build: The request body of the build.

      Processes the body passed in the constructor

      :return: the body.
