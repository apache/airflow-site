   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.models.BaseOperator`

   Create a new cluster on Google Cloud Dataproc. The operator will wait until the
   creation is successful or an error occurs in the creation process. If the cluster
   already exists and ``use_if_exists`` is True then the operator will:

   - if cluster state is ERROR then delete it if specified and raise error
   - if cluster state is CREATING wait for it and then check for ERROR state
   - if cluster state is DELETING wait for it and then create new cluster

   Please refer to

   https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.regions.clusters

   parameters detailed in the link are available as a parameter to this operator.

   :param project_id: Optional. The ID of the Google Cloud project that the cluster belongs to (templated).

.. py:class:: DataprocJobBaseOperator(*, job_name = '{{task.task_id}}_{{ds_nodash}}', cluster_name = 'cluster-1', project_id = None, dataproc_properties = None, dataproc_jars = None, gcp_conn_id = 'google_cloud_default', delegate_to = None, labels = None, region = None, job_error_states = None, impersonation_chain = None, asynchronous = False, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.models.BaseOperator`

   The base class for operators that launch job on DataProc.

   :param job_name: The job name used in the DataProc cluster. This name by default
       is the task_id appended with the execution data, but can be templated. The
       name will always be appended with a random number to avoid name clashes.
   :param cluster_name: The name of the DataProc cluster.
   :param project_id: The ID of the Google Cloud project the cluster belongs to,
       if not specified the project will be inferred from the provided GCP connection.
   :param dataproc_properties: Map for the Hive properties. Ideal to put in
       default arguments (templated)
   :param dataproc_jars: HCFS URIs of jar files to add to the CLASSPATH of the Hive server and Hadoop
       MapReduce (MR) tasks. Can contain Hive SerDes and UDFs. (templated)
   :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use connecting to Google Cloud.
   :param delegate_to: The account to impersonate using domain-wide delegation of authority,
       if any. For this to work, the service account making the request must have
       domain-wide delegation enabled.
   :param labels: The labels to associate with this job. Label keys must contain 1 to 63 characters,
       and must conform to RFC 1035. Label values may be empty, but, if present, must contain 1 to 63
       characters, and must conform to RFC 1035. No more than 32 labels can be associated with a job.
   :param region: The specified region where the dataproc cluster is created.
   :param job_error_states: Job states that should be considered error states.
       Any states in this set will result in an error being raised and failure of the
       task. Eg, if the ``CANCELLED`` state should also be considered a task failure,
       pass in ``{'ERROR', 'CANCELLED'}``. Possible values are currently only
       ``'ERROR'`` and ``'CANCELLED'``, but could change in the future. Defaults to
       ``{'ERROR'}``.
   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
       of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).
   :param asynchronous: Flag to return after submitting the job to the Dataproc API.
       This is useful for submitting long running jobs and
       waiting on them asynchronously using the DataprocJobSensor

   :var dataproc_job_id: The actual "jobId" as submitted to the Dataproc API.
       This is useful for identifying or linking to the job in the Google Cloud Console
       Dataproc UI, as the actual "jobId" submitted to the Dataproc API is appended with
       an 8 character random string.
   :vartype dataproc_job_id: str

      Refer to get_template_context for more context.


   .. py:method:: on_kill(self)

      Callback called when the operator is killed.
      Cancel any running job.



.. py:class:: DataprocSubmitPigJobOperator(*, query = None, query_uri = None, variables = None, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`DataprocJobBaseOperator`

   Start a Pig query Job on a Cloud DataProc cluster. The parameters of the operation
   will be passed to the cluster.

   It's a good practice to define dataproc_* parameters in the default_args of the dag
   like the cluster name and UDFs.

   .. code-block:: python

       default_args = {
           "cluster_name": "cluster-1",
           "dataproc_pig_jars": [
               "gs://example/udf/jar/datafu/1.2.0/datafu.jar",
               "gs://example/udf/jar/gpig/1.2/gpig.jar",
           ],
       }

   You can pass a pig script as string or file reference. Use variables to pass on
   variables for the pig script to be resolved on the cluster or use the parameters to
   be resolved in the script as template parameters.

   **Example**: ::

       t1 = DataProcPigOperator(
               task_id='dataproc_pig',
               query='a_pig_script.pig',

.. py:class:: DataprocListBatchesOperator(*, region, project_id = None, page_size = None, page_token = None, retry = None, timeout = None, metadata = (), gcp_conn_id = 'google_cloud_default', impersonation_chain = None, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.models.BaseOperator`

   Lists batch workloads.

   :param region: Required. The Cloud Dataproc region in which to handle the request.
   :param project_id: Optional. The ID of the Google Cloud project that the cluster belongs to.
   :param page_size: Optional. The maximum number of batches to return in each response. The service may
       return fewer than this value. The default page size is 20; the maximum page size is 1000.
   :param page_token: Optional. A page token received from a previous ``ListBatches`` call.
       Provide this token to retrieve the subsequent page.
   :param retry: Optional, a retry object used  to retry requests. If `None` is specified, requests
       will not be retried.
   :param timeout: Optional, the amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the request to complete.
       Note that if `retry` is specified, the timeout applies to each individual attempt.
   :param metadata: Optional, additional metadata that is provided to the method.
   :param gcp_conn_id: Optional, the connection ID used to connect to Google Cloud Platform.
   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
       of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).

      This is the main method to derive when creating an operator.
