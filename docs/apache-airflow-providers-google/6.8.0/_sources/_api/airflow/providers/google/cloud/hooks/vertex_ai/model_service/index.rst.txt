.. py:class:: ModelServiceHook(gcp_conn_id = 'google_cloud_default', delegate_to = None, impersonation_chain = None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.google.common.hooks.base_google.GoogleBaseHook`

   Hook for Google Cloud Vertex AI Endpoint Service APIs.

   .. py:method:: get_model_service_client(self, region = None)

      Returns ModelServiceClient.


   .. py:method:: extract_model_id(obj)
      :staticmethod:

      Returns unique id of the model.


   .. py:method:: wait_for_operation(self, operation, timeout = None)

      Waits for long-lasting operation to complete.


   .. py:method:: delete_model(self, project_id, region, model, retry = None, timeout = None, metadata = ())

      Deletes a Model.

      :param project_id: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud project that the service belongs to.
      :param region: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud region that the service belongs to.
      :param model: Required. The name of the Model resource to be deleted.
      :param retry: Designation of what errors, if any, should be retried.
      :param timeout: The timeout for this request.
      :param metadata: Strings which should be sent along with the request as metadata.


   .. py:method:: export_model(self, project_id, region, model, output_config, retry = None, timeout = None, metadata = ())

      Exports a trained, exportable Model to a location specified by the user.

      :param project_id: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud project that the service belongs to.
      :param region: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud region that the service belongs to.
      :param model: Required. The resource name of the Model to export.
      :param output_config:  Required. The desired output location and configuration.
      :param retry: Designation of what errors, if any, should be retried.
      :param timeout: The timeout for this request.
      :param metadata: Strings which should be sent along with the request as metadata.


   .. py:method:: list_models(self, project_id, region, filter = None, page_size = None, page_token = None, read_mask = None, order_by = None, retry = None, timeout = None, metadata = ())

      Lists Models in a Location.

      :param project_id: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud project that the service belongs to.
      :param region: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud region that the service belongs to.
      :param filter: An expression for filtering the results of the request. For field names both
          snake_case and camelCase are supported.
          -  ``model`` supports = and !=. ``model`` represents the Model ID, i.e. the last segment of the
          Model's [resource name][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.Model.name].
          -  ``display_name`` supports = and !=
          -  ``labels`` supports general map functions that is:
          --  ``labels.key=value`` - key:value equality
          --  \`labels.key:\* or labels:key - key existence
          --  A key including a space must be quoted. ``labels."a key"``.
      :param page_size: The standard list page size.
      :param page_token: The standard list page token. Typically obtained via
          [ListModelsResponse.next_page_token][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.ListModelsResponse.next_page_token]
          of the previous
          [ModelService.ListModels][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.ModelService.ListModels]
          call.
      :param read_mask: Mask specifying which fields to read.
      :param order_by: A comma-separated list of fields to order by, sorted in ascending order. Use "desc"
          after a field name for descending.
      :param retry: Designation of what errors, if any, should be retried.
      :param timeout: The timeout for this request.
      :param metadata: Strings which should be sent along with the request as metadata.


   .. py:method:: upload_model(self, project_id, region, model, retry = None, timeout = None, metadata = ())

      Uploads a Model artifact into Vertex AI.

      :param project_id: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud project that the service belongs to.
      :param region: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud region that the service belongs to.
      :param model:  Required. The Model to create.
      :param retry: Designation of what errors, if any, should be retried.
      :param timeout: The timeout for this request.
      :param metadata: Strings which should be sent along with the request as metadata.
