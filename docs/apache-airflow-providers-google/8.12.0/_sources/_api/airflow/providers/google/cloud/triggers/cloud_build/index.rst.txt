   CloudBuildCreateBuildTrigger run on the trigger worker to perform create Build operation

   :param id_: The ID of the build.
   :param project_id: Google Cloud Project where the job is running
   :param gcp_conn_id: Optional, the connection ID used to connect to Google Cloud Platform.
   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
       of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).
   :param delegate_to: The account to impersonate using domain-wide delegation of authority,
       if any. For this to work, the service account making the request must have
       domain-wide delegation enabled.
   :param poll_interval: polling period in seconds to check for the status
   :param location: The location of the project.
