.. py:class:: CloudNaturalLanguageHook(gcp_conn_id = 'google_cloud_default', delegate_to = None, impersonation_chain = None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.google.common.hooks.base_google.GoogleBaseHook`

   Hook for Google Cloud Natural Language Service.

   :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use when fetching connection info.
   :param delegate_to: The account to impersonate using domain-wide delegation of authority,
       if any. For this to work, the service account making the request must have
       domain-wide delegation enabled.
   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
       of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
       If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
       If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
       Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
       account from the list granting this role to the originating account.

   .. py:method:: get_conn()

      Retrieves connection to Cloud Natural Language service.

      :return: Cloud Natural Language service object
      :rtype: google.cloud.language_v1.LanguageServiceClient


   .. py:method:: analyze_entities(document, encoding_type = None, retry = DEFAULT, timeout = None, metadata = ())

      Finds named entities in the text along with entity types,
      salience, mentions for each entity, and other properties.

      :param document: Input document.
          If a dict is provided, it must be of the same form as the protobuf message Document
      :param encoding_type: The encoding type used by the API to calculate offsets.
      :param retry: A retry object used to retry requests. If None is specified, requests will not be
          retried.
      :param timeout: The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the request to complete. Note that if
          retry is specified, the timeout applies to each individual attempt.
      :param metadata: Additional metadata that is provided to the method.
      :rtype: google.cloud.language_v1.types.AnalyzeEntitiesResponse


   .. py:method:: analyze_entity_sentiment(document, encoding_type = None, retry = DEFAULT, timeout = None, metadata = ())

      Finds entities, similar to AnalyzeEntities in the text and analyzes sentiment associated with each
      entity and its mentions.

      :param document: Input document.
          If a dict is provided, it must be of the same form as the protobuf message Document
      :param encoding_type: The encoding type used by the API to calculate offsets.
      :param retry: A retry object used to retry requests. If None is specified, requests will not be
          retried.
      :param timeout: The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the request to complete. Note that if
          retry is specified, the timeout applies to each individual attempt.
      :param metadata: Additional metadata that is provided to the method.
