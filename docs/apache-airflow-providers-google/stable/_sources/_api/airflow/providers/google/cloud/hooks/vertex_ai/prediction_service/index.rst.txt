.. py:class:: PredictionServiceHook(gcp_conn_id = 'google_cloud_default', impersonation_chain = None, **kwargs)


   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.google.common.hooks.base_google.GoogleBaseHook`

   Hook for Google Cloud Vertex AI Prediction API.

   .. py:method:: get_prediction_service_client(region = None)

      Return PredictionServiceClient object.

      :param region: The ID of the Google Cloud region that the service belongs to. Default is None.

      :return: `google.cloud.aiplatform_v1.services.prediction_service.client.PredictionServiceClient` instance.


   .. py:method:: predict(endpoint_id, instances, location, project_id = PROVIDE_PROJECT_ID, parameters = None, retry = DEFAULT, timeout = None, metadata = ())

      Perform an online prediction and returns the prediction result in the response.

      :param endpoint_id: Name of the endpoint_id requested to serve the prediction.
      :param instances: Required. The instances that are the input to the prediction call. A DeployedModel
          may have an upper limit on the number of instances it supports per request, and when it is
          exceeded the prediction call errors in case of AutoML Models, or, in case of customer created
          Models, the behaviour is as documented by that Model.
      :param parameters: Additional domain-specific parameters, any string must be up to 25000 characters long.
      :param project_id: ID of the Google Cloud project where model is located if None then
          default project_id is used.
      :param location: The location of the project.
      :param retry: A retry object used to retry requests. If `None` is specified, requests will not be
          retried.
      :param timeout: The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for the request to complete. Note that if
          `retry` is specified, the timeout applies to each individual attempt.
      :param metadata: Additional metadata that is provided to the method.
