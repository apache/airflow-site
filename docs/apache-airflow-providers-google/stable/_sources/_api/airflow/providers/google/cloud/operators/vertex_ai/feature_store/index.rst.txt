   Initiate a synchronization operation for a Feature View in Vertex AI Feature Store.

   This operator triggers a sync operation that updates the online serving data for a feature view
   based on the latest data in the underlying batch source. The sync operation ensures that
   the online feature values are up-to-date for real-time serving.

   :param project_id: Required. The ID of the Google Cloud project that contains the feature store.
       This is used to identify which project's resources to interact with.
   :param location: Required. The location of the feature store (e.g., 'us-central1', 'us-east1').
       This specifies the Google Cloud region where the feature store resources are located.
   :param feature_online_store_id: Required. The ID of the online feature store that contains
       the feature view to be synchronized. This store serves as the online serving layer.
   :param feature_view_id: Required. The ID of the feature view to synchronize. This identifies
       the specific view that needs to have its online values updated from the batch source.
   :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use for connecting to Google Cloud Platform.
       Defaults to 'google_cloud_default'.
   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials. Can be either a single account or a chain of accounts required to
       get the access_token of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated
       in the request. If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role. If set as a sequence, the identities
       from the list must grant Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly
       preceding identity, with first account from the list granting this role to the
       originating account.

   .. py:attribute:: template_fields
      :type: collections.abc.Sequence[str]
      :value: ('project_id', 'location', 'feature_online_store_id', 'feature_view_id')

      

   .. py:method:: execute(context)

      Execute the feature view sync operation.



.. py:class:: GetFeatureViewSyncOperator(*, location, feature_view_sync_name, gcp_conn_id = 'google_cloud_default', impersonation_chain = None, **kwargs)


   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.cloud_base.GoogleCloudBaseOperator`

   Retrieve the status and details of a Feature View synchronization operation.

   This operator fetches information about a specific feature view sync operation,
   including its current status, timing information, and synchronization metrics.
   It's typically used to monitor the progress of a sync operation initiated by
   the SyncFeatureViewOperator.

   :param location: Required. The location of the feature store (e.g., 'us-central1', 'us-east1').
       This specifies the Google Cloud region where the feature store resources are located.
   :param feature_view_sync_name: Required. The full resource name of the feature view
       sync operation to retrieve. This is typically the return value from a
       SyncFeatureViewOperator execution.
   :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use for connecting to Google Cloud Platform.
       Defaults to 'google_cloud_default'.
   :param impersonation_chain: Optional service account to impersonate using short-term
       credentials. Can be either a single account or a chain of accounts required to
       get the access_token of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated
       in the request. If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
       the Service Account Token Creator IAM role. If set as a sequence, the identities
       from the list must grant Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly
       preceding identity, with first account from the list granting this role to the
       originating account.

   .. py:attribute:: template_fields
      :type: collections.abc.Sequence[str]
      :value: ('location', 'feature_view_sync_name')

      

   .. py:method:: execute(context)

      Execute the get feature view sync operation.
