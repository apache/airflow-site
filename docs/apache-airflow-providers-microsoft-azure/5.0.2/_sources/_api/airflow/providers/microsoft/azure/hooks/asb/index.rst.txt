.. py:class:: BaseAzureServiceBusHook(azure_service_bus_conn_id = default_conn_name)

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.hooks.base.BaseHook`

   BaseAzureServiceBusHook class to create session and create connection using connection string

   :param azure_service_bus_conn_id: Reference to the
       :ref:`Azure Service Bus connection<howto/connection:azure_service_bus>`.

   .. py:attribute:: conn_name_attr
      :annotation: = azure_service_bus_conn_id

      

   .. py:attribute:: default_conn_name
      :annotation: = azure_service_bus_default

      

   .. py:attribute:: conn_type
      :annotation: = azure_service_bus

      

   .. py:attribute:: hook_name
      :annotation: = Azure Service Bus

      

   .. py:method:: get_ui_field_behaviour()
      :staticmethod:

      Returns custom field behaviour


   .. py:method:: get_conn()
      :abstractmethod:

      Returns connection for the hook.



.. py:class:: AdminClientHook(azure_service_bus_conn_id = default_conn_name)

   Bases: :py:obj:`BaseAzureServiceBusHook`

   Interacts with ServiceBusAdministrationClient client
   to create, update, list, and delete resources of a
   Service Bus namespace.  This hook uses the same Azure Service Bus client connection inherited
   from the base class

   .. py:method:: get_conn()

      Create and returns ServiceBusAdministrationClient by using the connection
      string in connection details


   .. py:method:: create_queue(queue_name, max_delivery_count = 10, dead_lettering_on_message_expiration = True, enable_batched_operations = True)

      Create Queue by connecting to service Bus Admin client return the QueueProperties

      :param queue_name: The name of the queue or a QueueProperties with name.
      :param max_delivery_count: The maximum delivery count. A message is automatically
          dead lettered after this number of deliveries. Default value is 10..
      :param dead_lettering_on_message_expiration: A value that indicates whether this subscription has
          dead letter support when a message expires.
      :param enable_batched_operations: Value that indicates whether server-side batched
          operations are enabled.


   .. py:method:: delete_queue(queue_name)

      Delete the queue by queue_name in service bus namespace

      :param queue_name: The name of the queue or a QueueProperties with name.


   .. py:method:: delete_subscription(subscription_name, topic_name)

      Delete a topic subscription entities under a ServiceBus Namespace

      :param subscription_name: The subscription name that will own the rule in topic
      :param topic_name: The topic that will own the subscription rule.



.. py:class:: MessageHook(azure_service_bus_conn_id = default_conn_name)

   Bases: :py:obj:`BaseAzureServiceBusHook`

   Interacts with ServiceBusClient and acts as a high level interface
   for getting ServiceBusSender and ServiceBusReceiver.

   .. py:method:: get_conn()

      Create and returns ServiceBusClient by using the connection string in connection details


   .. py:method:: send_message(queue_name, messages, batch_message_flag = False)

      By using ServiceBusClient Send message(s) to a Service Bus Queue. By using
      batch_message_flag it enables and send message as batch message

      :param queue_name: The name of the queue or a QueueProperties with name.
      :param messages: Message which needs to be sent to the queue. It can be string or list of string.
      :param batch_message_flag: bool flag, can be set to True if message needs to be
          sent as batch message.


   .. py:method:: send_list_messages(sender, messages)
      :staticmethod:


   .. py:method:: send_batch_message(sender, messages)
      :staticmethod:


   .. py:method:: receive_message(queue_name, max_message_count = 1, max_wait_time = None)

      Receive a batch of messages at once in a specified Queue name

      :param queue_name: The name of the queue name or a QueueProperties with name.
      :param max_message_count: Maximum number of messages in the batch.
      :param max_wait_time: Maximum time to wait in seconds for the first message to arrive.


   .. py:method:: receive_subscription_message(topic_name, subscription_name, max_message_count, max_wait_time)

      Receive a batch of subscription message at once. This approach is optimal if you wish
      to process multiple messages simultaneously, or perform an ad-hoc receive as a single call.

      :param subscription_name: The subscription name that will own the rule in topic
      :param topic_name: The topic that will own the subscription rule.
      :param max_message_count: Maximum number of messages in the batch.
          Actual number returned will depend on prefetch_count and incoming stream rate.
          Setting to None will fully depend on the prefetch config. The default value is 1.
      :param max_wait_time: Maximum time to wait in seconds for the first message to arrive. If no
          messages arrive, and no timeout is specified, this call will not return until the
          connection is closed. If specified, an no messages arrive within the timeout period,
          an empty list will be returned.
