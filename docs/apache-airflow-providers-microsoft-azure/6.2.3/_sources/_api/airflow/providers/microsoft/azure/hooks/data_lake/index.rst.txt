.. py:class:: AzureDataLakeHook(azure_data_lake_conn_id = default_conn_name)


   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.hooks.base.BaseHook`

   Integration with Azure Data Lake.

   AzureDataLakeHook communicates via a REST API compatible with WebHDFS. Make
   sure that a Airflow connection of type ``azure_data_lake`` exists.
   Authorization can be done by supplying a *login* (=Client ID), *password*
   (=Client Secret), and extra fields *tenant* (Tenant) and *account_name*
   (Account Name). See connection ``azure_data_lake_default`` for an example.

   Client ID and secret should be in user and password parameters.
   Tenant and account name should be extra field as
   ``{"tenant": "<TENANT>", "account_name": "ACCOUNT_NAME"}``.

   :param azure_data_lake_conn_id: Reference to
       :ref:`Azure Data Lake connection<howto/connection:adl>`.

      :return: True if the file exists, False otherwise.


   .. py:method:: upload_file(local_path, remote_path, nthreads = 64, overwrite = True, buffersize = 4194304, blocksize = 4194304, **kwargs)

      Upload a file to Azure Data Lake.

      :param local_path: local path. Can be single file, directory (in which case,
          upload recursively) or glob pattern. Recursive glob patterns using `**`
          are not supported.
      :param remote_path: Remote path to upload to; if multiple files, this is the
          directory root to write within.
      :param nthreads: Number of threads to use. If None, uses the number of cores.
      :param overwrite: Whether to forcibly overwrite existing files/directories.
          If False and remote path is a directory, will quit regardless if any files
          would be overwritten or not. If True, only matching filenames are actually
          overwritten.
      :param buffersize: int [2**22]

          directory to write within. Will create directories as required.
      :param remote_path: remote path/globstring to use to find remote files.
          Recursive glob patterns using `**` are not supported.
      :param nthreads: Number of threads to use. If None, uses the number of cores.
      :param overwrite: Whether to forcibly overwrite existing files/directories.
          If False and remote path is a directory, will quit regardless if any files
          would be overwritten or not. If True, only matching filenames are actually
          overwritten.
      :param buffersize: int [2**22]

      :param path: full path/globstring to use to list files in ADLS


   .. py:method:: remove(path, recursive = False, ignore_not_found = True)

      Remove files in Azure Data Lake Storage.

.. py:class:: AzureDataLakeStorageV2Hook(adls_conn_id, public_read = False)


   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.hooks.base.BaseHook`

   Interact with a ADLS gen2 storage account.

   It mainly helps to create and manage directories and files in storage
   accounts that have a hierarchical namespace. Using Adls_v2 connection
   details create DataLakeServiceClient object.

   Due to Wasb is marked as legacy and and retirement of the (ADLS1), it would
   be nice to implement ADLS gen2 hook for interacting with the storage account.
