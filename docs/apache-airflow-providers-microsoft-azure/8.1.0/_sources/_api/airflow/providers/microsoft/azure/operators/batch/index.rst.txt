       Job on that Compute Node. Required if batch_job_release_task is set.
   :param batch_job_release_task: The Job Release Task. Use to undo changes to Compute Nodes
       made by the Job Preparation Task
   :param batch_task_display_name:  The display name for the task.
       The display name need not be unique
   :param batch_task_container_settings: The settings for the container under which the Task runs
   :param batch_start_task: A Task specified to run on each Compute Node as it joins the Pool.
       The Task runs when the Compute Node is added to the Pool or
       when the Compute Node is restarted.
   :param batch_max_retries: The number of times to retry this batch operation before it's
       considered a failed operation. Default is 3
   :param batch_task_resource_files: A list of files that the Batch service will
       download to the Compute Node before running the command line.
   :param batch_task_output_files: A list of files that the Batch service will upload
       from the Compute Node after running the command line.
   :param batch_task_user_identity: The user identity under which the Task runs.
       If omitted, the Task runs as a non-administrative user unique to the Task.
   :param target_low_priority_nodes: The desired number of low-priority Compute Nodes in the Pool.
       This property must not be specified if enable_auto_scale is set to true.
   :param target_dedicated_nodes: The desired number of dedicated Compute Nodes in the Pool.
       This property must not be specified if enable_auto_scale is set to true.
   :param enable_auto_scale: Whether the Pool size should automatically adjust over time. Default is false
   :param auto_scale_formula: A formula for the desired number of Compute Nodes in the Pool.
       This property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to false.
       It is required if enableAutoScale is set to true.
   :param azure_batch_conn_id: The :ref:`Azure Batch connection id<howto/connection:azure_batch>`

       use_latest_image_and_sku is set to True
   :param vm_sku: The name of the virtual machine sku to use
   :param vm_version: The version of the virtual machine
   :param vm_version: str | None
   :param vm_node_agent_sku_id: The node agent sku id of the virtual machine
   :param os_family: The Azure Guest OS family to be installed on the virtual machines in the Pool.
   :param os_version: The OS family version
   :param timeout: The amount of time to wait for the job to complete in minutes. Default is 25

   .. py:method:: hook()

      Create and return an AzureBatchHook (cached).


   .. py:method:: get_hook()

      Create and return an AzureBatchHook.


   .. py:method:: execute(context)

      Derive when creating an operator.

      Context is the same dictionary used as when rendering jinja templates.

      Refer to get_template_context for more context.


   .. py:method:: on_kill()

      Override this method to clean up subprocesses when a task instance gets killed.

      Any use of the threading, subprocess or multiprocessing module within an
      operator needs to be cleaned up, or it will leave ghost processes behind.


   .. py:method:: clean_up(pool_id = None, job_id = None)

      Delete the given pool and job in the batch account.

      :param pool_id: The id of the pool to delete
      :param job_id: The id of the job to delete
