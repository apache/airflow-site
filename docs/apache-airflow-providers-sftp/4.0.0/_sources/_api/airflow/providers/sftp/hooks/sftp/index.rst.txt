.. py:class:: SFTPHook(ssh_conn_id = 'sftp_default', ssh_hook = None, *args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.ssh.hooks.ssh.SSHHook`

   This hook is inherited from SSH hook. Please refer to SSH hook for the input
   arguments.

   Interact with SFTP.

   :Pitfalls::

       - In contrast with FTPHook describe_directory only returns size, type and
         modify. It doesn't return unix.owner, unix.mode, perm, unix.group and
         unique.
       - retrieve_file and store_file only take a local full path and not a
          buffer.
       - If no mode is passed to create_directory it will be created with 777
         permissions.

   Errors that may occur throughout but should be handled downstream.

   For consistency reasons with SSHHook, the preferred parameter is "ssh_conn_id".

   :param ssh_conn_id: The :ref:`sftp connection id<howto/connection:sftp>`
   :param ssh_hook: Optional SSH hook (included to support passing of an SSH hook to the SFTP operator)

      Creates a directory on the remote system.

      :param path: full path to the remote directory to create
      :param mode: permissions to set the directory with


   .. py:method:: isdir(path)

      Checks if the path provided is a directory or not.

      :param path: full path to the remote directory to check


   .. py:method:: isfile(path)

      Checks if the path provided is a file or not.

      :param path: full path to the remote file to check


   .. py:method:: create_directory(path, mode = 777)

      Creates a directory on the remote system.

      :param path: full path to the remote directory to create
      :param mode: int representation of octal mode for directory


   .. py:method:: delete_directory(path)

      Deletes a directory on the remote system.

      :param path: full path to the remote directory to delete


   .. py:method:: retrieve_file(remote_full_path, local_full_path)

      Transfers the remote file to a local location.
      If local_full_path is a string path, the file will be put
      at that location

      :param remote_full_path: full path to the remote file
      :param local_full_path: full path to the local file


   .. py:method:: store_file(remote_full_path, local_full_path, confirm = True)

      Transfers a local file to the remote location.
      If local_full_path_or_buffer is a string path, the file will be read
      from that location

      :param remote_full_path: full path to the remote file
      :param local_full_path: full path to the local file

      :param path: full path to the remote file


   .. py:method:: path_exists(path)

      Returns True if a remote entity exists

      :param path: full path to the remote file or directory


   .. py:method:: walktree(path, fcallback, dcallback, ucallback, recurse = True)

      Recursively descend, depth first, the directory tree rooted at
      path, calling discreet callback functions for each regular file,
      directory and unknown file type.

      :param str path:
          root of remote directory to descend, use '.' to start at
          :attr:`.pwd`

          callback function to invoke for a regular file.
          (form: ``func(str)``)
      :param callable dcallback:
          callback function to invoke for a directory. (form: ``func(str)``)
      :param callable ucallback:
          callback function to invoke for an unknown file type.
          (form: ``func(str)``)
      :param bool recurse: *Default: True* - should it recurse

      :returns: None


   .. py:method:: get_tree_map(path, prefix = None, delimiter = None)

      Return tuple with recursive lists of files, directories and unknown paths from given path.
      It is possible to filter results by giving prefix and/or delimiter parameters.

      :param path: path from which tree will be built
      :param prefix: if set paths will be added if start with prefix
      :param delimiter: if set paths will be added if end with delimiter
      :return: tuple with list of files, dirs and unknown items
      :rtype: Tuple[List[str], List[str], List[str]]

      :param path: path to be checked
      :param fnmatch_pattern: The pattern that will be matched with `fnmatch`
