.. py:class:: SFTPHook(ssh_conn_id = 'sftp_default', ssh_hook = None, *args, **kwargs)


   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.providers.ssh.hooks.ssh.SSHHook`

   Interact with SFTP.

   This hook inherits the SSH hook. Please refer to SSH hook for the input
   arguments.

   :Pitfalls::

       - In contrast with FTPHook describe_directory only returns size, type and
         modify. It doesn't return unix.owner, unix.mode, perm, unix.group and
         unique.
       - retrieve_file and store_file only take a local full path and not a
          buffer.
       - If no mode is passed to create_directory it will be created with 777
         permissions.

   Errors that may occur throughout but should be handled downstream.

   For consistency reasons with SSHHook, the preferred parameter is "ssh_conn_id".

   :param ssh_conn_id: The :ref:`sftp connection id<howto/connection:sftp>`
   :param ssh_hook: Optional SSH hook (included to support passing of an SSH hook to the SFTP operator)

   .. py:attribute:: conn_name_attr
      :value: 'ssh_conn_id'

      

   .. py:attribute:: default_conn_name
      :value: 'sftp_default'

      

   .. py:attribute:: conn_type
      :value: 'sftp'

      

   .. py:attribute:: hook_name
      :value: 'SFTP'

      

   .. py:method:: get_ui_field_behaviour()
      :classmethod:

      Returns custom field behaviour.


   .. py:method:: get_conn()

      Opens an SFTP connection to the remote host.


   .. py:method:: close_conn()

      Closes the SFTP connection.


   .. py:method:: describe_directory(path)

      Get file information in a directory on the remote system.

      The return format is ``{filename: {attributes}}``. The remote system
      support the MLSD command.

      :param path: full path to the remote directory


   .. py:method:: list_directory(path)

      List files in a directory on the remote system.

      :param path: full path to the remote directory to list


   .. py:method:: mkdir(path, mode = 511)

      Create a directory on the remote system.

      The default mode is ``0o777``, but on some systems, the current umask
      value may be first masked out.

      :param path: full path to the remote directory to create
      :param mode: int permissions of octal mode for directory


   .. py:method:: isdir(path)

      Check if the path provided is a directory.

      :param path: full path to the remote directory to check


   .. py:method:: isfile(path)

      Check if the path provided is a file.

      :param path: full path to the remote file to check


   .. py:method:: create_directory(path, mode = 511)

      Create a directory on the remote system.

      The default mode is ``0o777``, but on some systems, the current umask
      value may be first masked out. Different from :func:`.mkdir`, this
      function attempts to create parent directories if needed, and returns
      silently if the target directory already exists.

      :param path: full path to the remote directory to create
      :param mode: int permissions of octal mode for directory


   .. py:method:: delete_directory(path)

      Delete a directory on the remote system.

      :param path: full path to the remote directory to delete


   .. py:method:: retrieve_file(remote_full_path, local_full_path, prefetch = True)

      Transfer the remote file to a local location.

      If local_full_path is a string path, the file will be put
      at that location.

      :param remote_full_path: full path to the remote file
      :param local_full_path: full path to the local file
      :param prefetch: controls whether prefetch is performed (default: True)


   .. py:method:: store_file(remote_full_path, local_full_path, confirm = True)

      Transfer a local file to the remote location.

      If local_full_path_or_buffer is a string path, the file will be read
      from that location.

      :param remote_full_path: full path to the remote file
      :param local_full_path: full path to the local file


   .. py:method:: delete_file(path)

      Remove a file on the server.

      :param path: full path to the remote file


   .. py:method:: get_mod_time(path)

      Get an entry's modification time.

      :param path: full path to the remote file


   .. py:method:: path_exists(path)

      Whether a remote entity exists.

      :param path: full path to the remote file or directory


   .. py:method:: walktree(path, fcallback, dcallback, ucallback, recurse = True)

      Recursively descend, depth first, the directory tree at ``path``.

      This calls discrete callback functions for each regular file, directory,
      and unknown file type.

      :param str path:
          root of remote directory to descend, use '.' to start at
          :attr:`.pwd`
      :param callable fcallback:
          callback function to invoke for a regular file.
          (form: ``func(str)``)
      :param callable dcallback:
          callback function to invoke for a directory. (form: ``func(str)``)
      :param callable ucallback:
          callback function to invoke for an unknown file type.
          (form: ``func(str)``)
      :param bool recurse: *Default: True* - should it recurse


   .. py:method:: get_tree_map(path, prefix = None, delimiter = None)

      Get tuple with recursive lists of files, directories and unknown paths.

      It is possible to filter results by giving prefix and/or delimiter parameters.

      :param path: path from which tree will be built
      :param prefix: if set paths will be added if start with prefix
      :param delimiter: if set paths will be added if end with delimiter
      :return: tuple with list of files, dirs and unknown items


   .. py:method:: test_connection()

      Test the SFTP connection by calling path with directory.


   .. py:method:: get_file_by_pattern(path, fnmatch_pattern)

      Get the first matching file based on the given fnmatch type pattern.

      :param path: path to be checked
      :param fnmatch_pattern: The pattern that will be matched with `fnmatch`
      :return: string containing the first found file, or an empty string if none matched


   .. py:method:: get_files_by_pattern(path, fnmatch_pattern)

      Get all matching files based on the given fnmatch type pattern.

      :param path: path to be checked
      :param fnmatch_pattern: The pattern that will be matched with `fnmatch`
      :return: list of string containing the found files, or an empty list if none matched
