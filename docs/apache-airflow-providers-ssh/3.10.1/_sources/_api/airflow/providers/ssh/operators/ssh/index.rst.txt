   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.models.BaseOperator`

   SSHOperator to execute commands on given remote host using the ssh_hook.

   :param ssh_hook: predefined ssh_hook to use for remote execution.
       Either `ssh_hook` or `ssh_conn_id` needs to be provided.
   :param ssh_conn_id: :ref:`ssh connection id<howto/connection:ssh>`
       from airflow Connections. `ssh_conn_id` will be ignored if
       `ssh_hook` is provided.
   :param remote_host: remote host to connect (templated)
       Nullable. If provided, it will replace the `remote_host` which was
       defined in `ssh_hook` or predefined in the connection of `ssh_conn_id`.
   :param command: command to execute on remote host. (templated)
   :param conn_timeout: timeout (in seconds) for maintaining the connection. The default is 10 seconds.
       Nullable. If provided, it will replace the `conn_timeout` which was
       predefined in the connection of `ssh_conn_id`.
   :param cmd_timeout: timeout (in seconds) for executing the command. The default is 10 seconds.
       Nullable, `None` means no timeout. If provided, it will replace the `cmd_timeout`
       which was predefined in the connection of `ssh_conn_id`.
   :param environment: a dict of shell environment variables. Note that the
       server will reject them silently if `AcceptEnv` is not set in SSH config. (templated)
   :param get_pty: request a pseudo-terminal from the server. Set to ``True``
       to have the remote process killed upon task timeout.
       The default is ``False`` but note that `get_pty` is forced to ``True``
       when the `command` starts with ``sudo``.
   :param banner_timeout: timeout to wait for banner from the server in seconds
   :param skip_on_exit_code: If command exits with this exit code, leave the task
       in ``skipped`` state (default: None). If set to ``None``, any non-zero
       exit code will be treated as a failure.

   If *do_xcom_push* is *True*, the numeric exit code emitted by
   the ssh session is pushed to XCom under key ``ssh_exit``.

      Derive when creating an operator.

      Context is the same dictionary used as when rendering jinja templates.

      Refer to get_template_context for more context.


   .. py:method:: tunnel()

      Get ssh tunnel.
