   Executes a Python callable.

   .. seealso::
       For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
       :ref:`howto/operator:PythonOperator`

   When running your callable, Airflow will pass a set of keyword arguments that can be used in your
   function. This set of kwargs correspond exactly to what you can use in your jinja templates.
   For this to work, you need to define ``**kwargs`` in your function header, or you can add directly the
   keyword arguments you would like to get - for example with the below code your callable will get
   the values of ``ti`` context variables.

   With explicit arguments:

   .. code-block:: python

      def my_python_callable(ti):
          pass

   With kwargs:

   .. code-block:: python

      def my_python_callable(**kwargs):
          ti = kwargs["ti"]


   :param python_callable: A reference to an object that is callable
   :param op_args: a list of positional arguments that will get unpacked when
       calling your callable
   :param op_kwargs: a dictionary of keyword arguments that will get unpacked
       in your function
   :param templates_dict: a dictionary where the values are templates that
       will get templated by the Airflow engine sometime between
       ``__init__`` and ``execute`` takes place and are made available
       in your callable's context after the template has been applied. (templated)
   :param templates_exts: a list of file extensions to resolve while
       processing templated fields, for examples ``['.sql', '.hql']``
   :param show_return_value_in_logs: a bool value whether to show return_value
       logs. Defaults to True, which allows return value log output.
       It can be set to False to prevent log output of return value when you return huge data
       such as transmission a large amount of XCom to TaskAPI.

   Bases: :py:obj:`PythonOperator`, :py:obj:`airflow.operators.branch.BranchMixIn`

   A workflow can "branch" or follow a path after the execution of this task.

   It derives the PythonOperator and expects a Python function that returns
   a single task_id, a single task_group_id, or a list of task_ids and/or
   task_group_ids to follow. The task_id(s) and/or task_group_id(s) returned
   should point to a task or task group directly downstream from {self}. All
   other "branches" or directly downstream tasks are marked with a state of
   ``skipped`` so that these paths can't move forward. The ``skipped`` states
   are propagated downstream to allow for the DAG state to fill up and
   the DAG run's state to be inferred.

   .. py:method:: execute(context)

      Derive when creating an operator.

      Context is the same dictionary used as when rendering jinja templates.

      Refer to get_template_context for more context.



.. py:class:: ShortCircuitOperator(*, ignore_downstream_trigger_rules = True, **kwargs)


   Bases: :py:obj:`PythonOperator`, :py:obj:`airflow.models.skipmixin.SkipMixin`

   Allows a pipeline to continue based on the result of a ``python_callable``.

   The ShortCircuitOperator is derived from the PythonOperator and evaluates the result of a
   ``python_callable``. If the returned result is False or a falsy value, the pipeline will be
   short-circuited. Downstream tasks will be marked with a state of "skipped" based on the short-circuiting
   mode configured. If the returned result is True or a truthy value, downstream tasks proceed as normal and
   an ``XCom`` of the returned result is pushed.

   The short-circuiting can be configured to either respect or ignore the ``trigger_rule`` set for
   downstream tasks. If ``ignore_downstream_trigger_rules`` is set to True, the default setting, all
   downstream tasks are skipped without considering the ``trigger_rule`` defined for tasks. However, if this
   parameter is set to False, the direct downstream tasks are skipped but the specified ``trigger_rule`` for
   other subsequent downstream tasks are respected. In this mode, the operator assumes the direct downstream
   tasks were purposely meant to be skipped but perhaps not other subsequent tasks.

   .. seealso::
       For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
       :ref:`howto/operator:ShortCircuitOperator`

   :param ignore_downstream_trigger_rules: If set to True, all downstream tasks from this operator task will
       be skipped. This is the default behavior. If set to False, the direct, downstream task(s) will be
       skipped but the ``trigger_rule`` defined for all other downstream tasks will be respected.

      Derive when creating an operator.

      Context is the same dictionary used as when rendering jinja templates.

   Bases: :py:obj:`_BasePythonVirtualenvOperator`

   Run a function in a virtualenv that is created and destroyed automatically.

   The function (has certain caveats) must be defined using def, and not be
   part of a class. All imports must happen inside the function
   and no variables outside the scope may be referenced. A global scope
   variable named virtualenv_string_args will be available (populated by
   string_args). In addition, one can pass stuff through op_args and op_kwargs, and one
   can use a return value.
   Note that if your virtualenv runs in a different Python major version than Airflow,
   you cannot use return values, op_args, op_kwargs, or use any macros that are being provided to
   Airflow through plugins. You can use string_args though.

   .. seealso::
       For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
       :ref:`howto/operator:PythonVirtualenvOperator`

   :param python_callable: A python function with no references to outside variables,
       defined with def, which will be run in a virtual environment.

         this requires to include cloudpickle in your requirements.
       - ``"dill"``: Use dill for serialize more complex types,
         this requires to include dill in your requirements.
   :param system_site_packages: Whether to include
       system_site_packages in your virtual environment.
       See virtualenv documentation for more information.
   :param pip_install_options: a list of pip install options when installing requirements
       See 'pip install -h' for available options

       processing templated fields, for examples ``['.sql', '.hql']``
   :param expect_airflow: expect Airflow to be installed in the target environment. If true, the operator
       will raise warning if Airflow is not installed, and it will attempt to load Airflow
       macros when starting.
   :param skip_on_exit_code: If python_callable exits with this exit code, leave the task
       in ``skipped`` state (default: None). If set to ``None``, any non-zero
       exit code will be treated as a failure.
   :param index_urls: an optional list of index urls to load Python packages from.
       If not provided the system pip conf will be used to source packages from.
   :param venv_cache_path: Optional path to the virtual environment parent folder in which the
       virtual environment will be cached, creates a sub-folder venv-{hash} whereas hash will be replaced
       with a checksum of requirements. If not provided the virtual environment will be created and deleted
       in a temp folder for every execution.
   :param env_vars: A dictionary containing additional environment variables to set for the virtual
       environment when it is executed.

       executed with a clean environment.
   :param use_dill: Deprecated, use ``serializer`` instead. Whether to use dill to serialize
       the args and result (pickle is default). This allows more complex types

   A workflow can "branch" or follow a path after the execution of this task.

   Extends ExternalPythonOperator, so expects to get Python:
   virtual environment that should be used (in ``VENV/bin`` folder). Should be absolute path,

.. py:function:: get_current_context()

   Retrieve the execution context dictionary without altering user method's signature.

   This is the simplest method of retrieving the execution context dictionary.

   **Old style:**

   .. code:: python

       def my_task(**context):
           ti = context["ti"]

   **New style:**

   .. code:: python

       from airflow.providers.standard.operators.python import get_current_context


       def my_task():
           context = get_current_context()
           ti = context["ti"]

   Current context will only have value if this method was called after an operator
   was starting to execute.
