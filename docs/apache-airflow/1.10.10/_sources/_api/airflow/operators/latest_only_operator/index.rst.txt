.. py:class:: LatestOnlyOperator

   Bases: :class:`airflow.models.BaseOperator`, :class:`airflow.models.SkipMixin`

   Allows a workflow to skip tasks that are not running during the most
   recent schedule interval.

   If the task is run outside of the latest schedule interval, all
   directly downstream tasks will be skipped.

   Note that downstream tasks are never skipped if the given DAG_Run is
   marked as externally triggered.
