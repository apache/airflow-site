   Bases: :class:`airflow.models.BaseOperator`

   Downloads a file from Google Cloud Storage.

   If a filename is supplied, it writes the file to the specified location, alternatively one can
   set the ``store_to_xcom_key`` parameter to True push the file content into xcom. When the file size
   exceeds the maximum size for xcom it is recommended to write to a file.

       Must not contain 'gs://' prefix. (templated)
   :type bucket: str

   :type object: str
   :param filename: The file path, including filename,  on the local file system (where the

       system.
   :type filename: str
   :param store_to_xcom_key: If this param is set, the operator will push
       the contents of the downloaded file to XCom with the key set in this

   :type store_to_xcom_key: str

       connecting to Google cloud storage.
