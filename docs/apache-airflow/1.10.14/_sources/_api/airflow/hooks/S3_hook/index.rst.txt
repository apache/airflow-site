      :type bucket: str
      :param keys: The key(s) to delete from S3 bucket.

          When ``keys`` is a string, it's supposed to be the key name of
          the single object to delete.

          When ``keys`` is a list, it's supposed to be the list of the
          keys to delete.
      :type keys: str or list
