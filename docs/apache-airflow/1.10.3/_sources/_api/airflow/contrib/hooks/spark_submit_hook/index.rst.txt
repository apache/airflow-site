   This hook is a wrapper around the spark-submit binary to kick off a spark-submit job.
   It requires that the "spark-submit" binary is in the PATH or the spark_home to be
   supplied.

   :param conf: Arbitrary Spark configuration properties
   :type conf: dict

       invalid connection_id is supplied, it will default to yarn.
   :type conn_id: str
   :param files: Upload additional files to the executor running the job, separated by a
       comma. Files will be placed in the working directory of each executor.

       executor (Default: 2)
   :type executor_cores: int

   :type executor_memory: str
   :param driver_memory: Memory allocated to the driver (e.g. 1000M, 2G) (Default: 1G)
   :type driver_memory: str
   :param keytab: Full path to the file that contains the keytab
   :type keytab: str

   :type num_executors: int
   :param application_args: Arguments for the application being submitted
   :type application_args: list

   :type env_vars: dict
   :param verbose: Whether to pass the verbose flag to spark-submit process for debugging
   :type verbose: bool
   :param spark_binary: The command to use for spark submit.
                        Some distros may use spark2-submit.

   .. method:: _resolve_should_track_driver_status(self)

      
      Determines whether or not this hook should poll the spark driver status through
      subsequent spark-submit status requests after the initial spark-submit request
      :return: if the driver status should be tracked

      



   

   .. method:: _resolve_connection(self)

      



   

   .. method:: get_conn(self)

      



   

   .. method:: _get_spark_binary_path(self)

      



   

   .. method:: _build_spark_submit_command(self, application)

      
      Construct the spark-submit command to execute.
      :param application: command to append to the spark-submit command
      :type application: str
      :return: full command to be executed

      



   

   .. method:: _build_track_driver_status_command(self)

      
      Construct the command to poll the driver status.

      :return: full command to be executed

      



   

   .. method:: submit(self, application='', **kwargs)

      
      Remote Popen to execute the spark-submit job

      :param application: Submitted application, jar or py file
      :type application: str
      :param kwargs: extra arguments to Popen (see subprocess.Popen)

      



   

   .. method:: _process_spark_submit_log(self, itr)

      
      Processes the log files and extracts useful information out of it.

      If the deploy-mode is 'client', log the output of the submit command as those
      are the output logs of the Spark worker directly.

      Remark: If the driver needs to be tracked for its status, the log-level of the
      spark deploy needs to be at least INFO (log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.deploy=INFO)

      :param itr: An iterator which iterates over the input of the subprocess

      



   

   .. method:: _process_spark_status_log(self, itr)

      
      parses the logs of the spark driver status query process

      :param itr: An iterator which iterates over the input of the subprocess

      



   

   .. method:: _start_driver_status_tracking(self)

      
      Polls the driver based on self._driver_id to get the status.
      Finish successfully when the status is FINISHED.
      Finish failed when the status is ERROR/UNKNOWN/KILLED/FAILED.

      Possible status:

      SUBMITTED
          Submitted but not yet scheduled on a worker
      RUNNING
          Has been allocated to a worker to run
      FINISHED
          Previously ran and exited cleanly
      RELAUNCHING
          Exited non-zero or due to worker failure, but has not yet
          started running again
      UNKNOWN
          The status of the driver is temporarily not known due to
          master failure recovery
      KILLED
          A user manually killed this driver
      FAILED
          The driver exited non-zero and was not supervised
      ERROR
          Unable to run or restart due to an unrecoverable error
          (e.g. missing jar file)

      



   

   .. method:: _build_spark_driver_kill_command(self)

      
      Construct the spark-submit command to kill a driver.
      :return: full command to kill a driver

      



   

   .. method:: on_kill(self)
