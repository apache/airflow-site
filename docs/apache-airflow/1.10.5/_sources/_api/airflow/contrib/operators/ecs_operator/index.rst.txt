   Execute a task on AWS EC2 Container Service

   :param task_definition: the task definition name on EC2 Container Service
   :type task_definition: str
   :param cluster: the cluster name on EC2 Container Service
   :type cluster: str
   :param overrides: the same parameter that boto3 will receive (templated):
       http://boto3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/services/ecs.html#ECS.Client.run_task
   :type overrides: dict
   :param aws_conn_id: connection id of AWS credentials / region name. If None,
       credential boto3 strategy will be used
       (http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/configuration.html).
   :type aws_conn_id: str
   :param region_name: region name to use in AWS Hook.
       Override the region_name in connection (if provided)
   :type region_name: str
   :param launch_type: the launch type on which to run your task ('EC2' or 'FARGATE')
   :type launch_type: str
   :param group: the name of the task group associated with the task
   :type group: str
   :param placement_constraints: an array of placement constraint objects to use for
       the task
   :type placement_constraints: list
   :param platform_version: the platform version on which your task is running
   :type platform_version: str
   :param network_configuration: the network configuration for the task
   :type network_configuration: dict
   :param awslogs_group: the CloudWatch group where your ECS container logs are stored.
       Only required if you want logs to be shown in the Airflow UI after your job has
       finished.
   :type awslogs_group: str
   :param awslogs_region: the region in which your CloudWatch logs are stored.
       If None, this is the same as the `region_name` parameter. If that is also None,
       this is the default AWS region based on your connection settings.
   :type awslogs_region: str
   :param awslogs_stream_prefix: the stream prefix that is used for the CloudWatch logs.
       This is usually based on some custom name combined with the name of the container.
