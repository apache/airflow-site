   Bases: :class:`airflow.utils.log.logging_mixin.LoggingMixin`

   Abstract base class for all operators. Since operators create objects that
   become nodes in the dag, BaseOperator contains many recursive methods for
   dag crawling behavior. To derive this class, you are expected to override
   the constructor as well as the 'execute' method.

   Operators derived from this class should perform or trigger certain tasks
   synchronously (wait for completion). Example of operators could be an
   operator that runs a Pig job (PigOperator), a sensor operator that
   waits for a partition to land in Hive (HiveSensorOperator), or one that
   moves data from Hive to MySQL (Hive2MySqlOperator). Instances of these
   operators (tasks) target specific operations, running specific scripts,
   functions or data transfers.

   This class is abstract and shouldn't be instantiated. Instantiating a
   class derived from this one results in the creation of a task object,
   which ultimately becomes a node in DAG objects. Task dependencies should
   be set by using the set_upstream and/or set_downstream methods.

   :param task_id: a unique, meaningful id for the task
   :type task_id: str
   :param owner: the owner of the task, using the unix username is recommended
   :type owner: str
   :param retries: the number of retries that should be performed before
       failing the task
   :type retries: int
   :param retry_delay: delay between retries
   :type retry_delay: datetime.timedelta
   :param retry_exponential_backoff: allow progressive longer waits between
       retries by using exponential backoff algorithm on retry delay (delay
       will be converted into seconds)
   :type retry_exponential_backoff: bool
   :param max_retry_delay: maximum delay interval between retries
   :type max_retry_delay: datetime.timedelta
   :param start_date: The ``start_date`` for the task, determines
       the ``execution_date`` for the first task instance. The best practice
       is to have the start_date rounded
       to your DAG's ``schedule_interval``. Daily jobs have their start_date
       some day at 00:00:00, hourly jobs have their start_date at 00:00
       of a specific hour. Note that Airflow simply looks at the latest
       ``execution_date`` and adds the ``schedule_interval`` to determine
       the next ``execution_date``. It is also very important
       to note that different tasks' dependencies
       need to line up in time. If task A depends on task B and their
       start_date are offset in a way that their execution_date don't line
       up, A's dependencies will never be met. If you are looking to delay
       a task, for example running a daily task at 2AM, look into the
       ``TimeSensor`` and ``TimeDeltaSensor``. We advise against using
       dynamic ``start_date`` and recommend using fixed ones. Read the
       FAQ entry about start_date for more information.
   :type start_date: datetime.datetime
   :param end_date: if specified, the scheduler won't go beyond this date
   :type end_date: datetime.datetime
   :param depends_on_past: when set to true, task instances will run
       sequentially while relying on the previous task's schedule to
       succeed. The task instance for the start_date is allowed to run.
   :type depends_on_past: bool
   :param wait_for_downstream: when set to true, an instance of task
       X will wait for tasks immediately downstream of the previous instance
       of task X to finish successfully before it runs. This is useful if the
       different instances of a task X alter the same asset, and this asset
       is used by tasks downstream of task X. Note that depends_on_past
       is forced to True wherever wait_for_downstream is used.
   :type wait_for_downstream: bool
   :param queue: which queue to target when running this job. Not
       all executors implement queue management, the CeleryExecutor
       does support targeting specific queues.
   :type queue: str
   :param dag: a reference to the dag the task is attached to (if any)
   :type dag: airflow.models.DAG
   :param priority_weight: priority weight of this task against other task.
       This allows the executor to trigger higher priority tasks before
       others when things get backed up. Set priority_weight as a higher
       number for more important tasks.
   :type priority_weight: int
   :param weight_rule: weighting method used for the effective total
       priority weight of the task. Options are:
       ``{ downstream | upstream | absolute }`` default is ``downstream``
       When set to ``downstream`` the effective weight of the task is the
       aggregate sum of all downstream descendants. As a result, upstream
       tasks will have higher weight and will be scheduled more aggressively
       when using positive weight values. This is useful when you have
       multiple dag run instances and desire to have all upstream tasks to
       complete for all runs before each dag can continue processing
       downstream tasks. When set to ``upstream`` the effective weight is the
       aggregate sum of all upstream ancestors. This is the opposite where
       downtream tasks have higher weight and will be scheduled more
       aggressively when using positive weight values. This is useful when you
       have multiple dag run instances and prefer to have each dag complete
       before starting upstream tasks of other dags.  When set to
       ``absolute``, the effective weight is the exact ``priority_weight``
       specified without additional weighting. You may want to do this when
       you know exactly what priority weight each task should have.
       Additionally, when set to ``absolute``, there is bonus effect of
       significantly speeding up the task creation process as for very large
       DAGS. Options can be set as string or using the constants defined in
       the static class ``airflow.utils.WeightRule``
   :type weight_rule: str
   :param pool: the slot pool this task should run in, slot pools are a
       way to limit concurrency for certain tasks
   :type pool: str
   :param sla: time by which the job is expected to succeed. Note that
       this represents the ``timedelta`` after the period is closed. For
       example if you set an SLA of 1 hour, the scheduler would send an email
       soon after 1:00AM on the ``2016-01-02`` if the ``2016-01-01`` instance
       has not succeeded yet.
       The scheduler pays special attention for jobs with an SLA and
       sends alert
       emails for sla misses. SLA misses are also recorded in the database
       for future reference. All tasks that share the same SLA time
       get bundled in a single email, sent soon after that time. SLA
       notification are sent once and only once for each task instance.
   :type sla: datetime.timedelta
   :param execution_timeout: max time allowed for the execution of
       this task instance, if it goes beyond it will raise and fail.
   :type execution_timeout: datetime.timedelta
   :param on_failure_callback: a function to be called when a task instance
       of this task fails. a context dictionary is passed as a single
       parameter to this function. Context contains references to related
       objects to the task instance and is documented under the macros
       section of the API.
   :type on_failure_callback: callable
   :param on_retry_callback: much like the ``on_failure_callback`` except
       that it is executed when retries occur.
   :type on_retry_callback: callable
   :param on_success_callback: much like the ``on_failure_callback`` except
       that it is executed when the task succeeds.
   :type on_success_callback: callable
   :param trigger_rule: defines the rule by which dependencies are applied
       for the task to get triggered. Options are:
       ``{ all_success | all_failed | all_done | one_success |
       one_failed | none_failed | none_skipped | dummy}``
       default is ``all_success``. Options can be set as string or
       using the constants defined in the static class
       ``airflow.utils.TriggerRule``
   :type trigger_rule: str
   :param resources: A map of resource parameter names (the argument names of the
       Resources constructor) to their values.
   :type resources: dict
   :param run_as_user: unix username to impersonate while running the task
   :type run_as_user: str
   :param task_concurrency: When set, a task will be able to limit the concurrent
       runs across execution_dates
   :type task_concurrency: int
   :param executor_config: Additional task-level configuration parameters that are
       interpreted by a specific executor. Parameters are namespaced by the name of
       executor.

       **Example**: to run this task in a specific docker container through
       the KubernetesExecutor ::

           MyOperator(...,
               executor_config={
               "KubernetesExecutor":
                   {"image": "myCustomDockerImage"}
                   }
           )

   :type executor_config: dict
   :param do_xcom_push: if True, an XCom is pushed containing the Operator's
       result
   :type do_xcom_push: bool

   .. attribute:: _comps
      

      

   .. attribute:: dag
      

      Returns the Operator's DAG if set, otherwise raises an error


   .. attribute:: dag_id
      

      Returns dag id if it has one or an adhoc + owner


   .. attribute:: deps
      

      Returns the list of dependencies for the operator. These differ from execution
      context dependencies in that they are specific to tasks and can be
      extended/overridden by subclasses.


   .. attribute:: schedule_interval
      

      The schedule interval of the DAG always wins over individual tasks so
      that tasks within a DAG always line up. The task still needs a
      schedule_interval as it may not be attached to a DAG.


   .. attribute:: priority_weight_total
      

      Total priority weight for the task. It might include all upstream or downstream tasks.
      depending on the weight rule.

        - WeightRule.ABSOLUTE - only own weight
        - WeightRule.DOWNSTREAM - adds priority weight of all downstream tasks
        - WeightRule.UPSTREAM - adds priority weight of all upstream tasks

      @property: list of tasks directly upstream


   .. attribute:: upstream_task_ids

   .. method:: __hash__(self)



   
   .. method:: __rshift__(self, other)

      Implements Self >> Other == self.set_downstream(other)

      If "Other" is a DAG, the DAG is assigned to the Operator.



   
   .. method:: __lshift__(self, other)

      Implements Self << Other == self.set_upstream(other)

      If "Other" is a DAG, the DAG is assigned to the Operator.



   
   .. method:: __rrshift__(self, other)

      Called for [DAG] >> [Operator] because DAGs don't have
      __rshift__ operators.



   
   .. method:: __rlshift__(self, other)

      Called for [DAG] << [Operator] because DAGs don't have
      __lshift__ operators.



   
   .. method:: has_dag(self)

      Returns True if the Operator has been assigned to a DAG.



   
   .. method:: operator_extra_link_dict(self)

      Returns dictionary of all extra links for the operator



   
   .. method:: global_operator_extra_link_dict(self)

      Returns dictionary of all global extra links



   
   .. method:: pre_execute(self, context)

      This hook is triggered right before self.execute() is called.



   
   .. method:: execute(self, context)

      This is the main method to derive when creating an operator.

      Refer to get_template_context for more context.



   
   .. method:: post_execute(self, context, result=None)

      This hook is triggered right after self.execute() is called.
      It is passed the execution context and any results returned by the
      operator.



   
   .. method:: on_kill(self)

      Override this method to cleanup subprocesses when a task instance
      gets killed. Any use of the threading, subprocess or multiprocessing
      module within an operator needs to be cleaned up or it will leave
      ghost processes behind.



   
   .. method:: __deepcopy__(self, memo)

      Hack sorting double chained task lists by task_id to avoid hitting
      max_depth on deepcopy operations.

      @property: extra links for the task. 



   
   .. method:: get_extra_links(self, dttm, link_name)

      For an operator, gets the URL that the external links specified in
      `extra_links` should point to.
