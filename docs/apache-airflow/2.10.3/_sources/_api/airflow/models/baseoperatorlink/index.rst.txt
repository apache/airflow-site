.. py:class:: BaseOperatorLink


   Abstract base class that defines how we get an operator link.

   .. py:property:: name
      :type: str
      :abstractmethod:

      Name of the link. This will be the button name on the task UI.


   .. py:attribute:: operators
      :type: ClassVar[list[type[airflow.models.baseoperator.BaseOperator]]]
      :value: []

      This property will be used by Airflow Plugins to find the Operators to which you want
      to assign this Operator Link

      :return: List of Operator classes used by task for which you want to create extra link


   .. py:method:: get_link(operator, *, ti_key)
      :abstractmethod:

      Link to external system.

      Note: The old signature of this function was ``(self, operator, dttm: datetime)``. That is still
      supported at runtime but is deprecated.

      :param operator: The Airflow operator object this link is associated to.
      :param ti_key: TaskInstance ID to return link for.
      :return: link to external system
