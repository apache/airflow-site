.. py:class:: BaseTrigger(**kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`abc.ABC`, :py:obj:`airflow.utils.log.logging_mixin.LoggingMixin`

   Base class for all triggers.

   A trigger has two contexts it can exist in:

    - Inside an Operator, when it's passed to TaskDeferred
    - Actively running in a trigger worker

   We use the same class for both situations, and rely on all Trigger classes
   to be able to return the arguments (possible to encode with Airflow-JSON) that will
   let them be re-instantiated elsewhere.

   .. py:method:: serialize()
      :abstractmethod:

      Returns the information needed to reconstruct this Trigger.

      :return: Tuple of (class path, keyword arguments needed to re-instantiate).


   .. py:method:: run()
      :abstractmethod:
      :async:

      Runs the trigger in an asynchronous context.

      The trigger should yield an Event whenever it wants to fire off
      an event, and return None if it is finished. Single-event triggers
      should thus yield and then immediately return.

      If it yields, it is likely that it will be resumed very quickly,
      but it may not be (e.g. if the workload is being moved to another
      triggerer process, or a multi-event trigger was being used for a
      single-event task defer).

      In either case, Trigger classes should assume they will be persisted,
      and then rely on cleanup() being called when they are no longer needed.


   .. py:method:: cleanup()
      :async:

      Cleanup the trigger.

      Called when the trigger is no longer needed, and it's being removed
      from the active triggerer process.

      This method follows the async/await pattern to allow to run the cleanup
      in triggerer main event loop. Exceptions raised by the cleanup method
      are ignored, so if you would like to be able to debug them and be notified
      that cleanup method failed, you should wrap your code with try/except block
      and handle it appropriately (in async-compatible way).


   .. py:method:: __repr__()

      Return repr(self).



.. py:class:: TriggerEvent(payload)

   Something that a trigger can fire when its conditions are met.

   Events must have a uniquely identifying value that would be the same
   wherever the trigger is run; this is to ensure that if the same trigger
   is being run in two locations (for HA reasons) that we can deduplicate its
   events.

   .. py:method:: __repr__()

      Return repr(self).


   .. py:method:: __eq__(other)

      Return self==value.
