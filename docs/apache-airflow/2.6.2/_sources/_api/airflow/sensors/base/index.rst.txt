.. py:class:: PokeReturnValue(is_done, xcom_value = None)


   Optional return value for poke methods.

   Sensors can optionally return an instance of the PokeReturnValue class in the poke method.
   If an XCom value is supplied when the sensor is done, then the XCom value will be
   pushed through the operator return value.
   :param is_done: Set to true to indicate the sensor can stop poking.
   :param xcom_value: An optional XCOM value to be returned by the operator.

.. py:class:: BaseSensorOperator(*, poke_interval = 60, timeout = conf.getfloat('sensors', 'default_timeout'), soft_fail = False, mode = 'poke', exponential_backoff = False, max_wait = None, silent_fail = False, **kwargs)


   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.models.baseoperator.BaseOperator`, :py:obj:`airflow.models.skipmixin.SkipMixin`

   Sensor operators are derived from this class and inherit these attributes.

   Sensor operators keep executing at a time interval and succeed when
   a criteria is met and fail if and when they time out.

   :param soft_fail: Set to true to mark the task as SKIPPED on failure
   :param poke_interval: Time in seconds that the job should wait in
       between each try
   :param timeout: Time, in seconds before the task times out and fails.
   :param mode: How the sensor operates.
       Options are: ``{ poke | reschedule }``, default is ``poke``.
       When set to ``poke`` the sensor is taking up a worker slot for its
       whole execution time and sleeps between pokes. Use this mode if the
       expected runtime of the sensor is short or if a short poke interval
       is required. Note that the sensor will hold onto a worker slot and
       a pool slot for the duration of the sensor's runtime in this mode.
       When set to ``reschedule`` the sensor task frees the worker slot when
       the criteria is not yet met and it's rescheduled at a later time. Use
       this mode if the time before the criteria is met is expected to be
       quite long. The poke interval should be more than one minute to
       prevent too much load on the scheduler.
   :param exponential_backoff: allow progressive longer waits between
       pokes by using exponential backoff algorithm
   :param max_wait: maximum wait interval between pokes, can be ``timedelta`` or ``float`` seconds
   :param silent_fail: If true, and poke method raises an exception different from
       AirflowSensorTimeout, AirflowTaskTimeout, AirflowSkipException
       and AirflowFailException, the sensor will log the error and continue
       its execution. Otherwise, the sensor task fails, and it can be retried
       based on the provided `retries` parameter.

   .. py:property:: reschedule

      Define mode rescheduled sensors.

   .. py:attribute:: valid_modes

      :value: ['poke', 'reschedule']

      

   .. py:attribute:: deps

      

   .. py:method:: poke(context)

      Function defined by the sensors while deriving this class should override.


   .. py:method:: execute(context)

      This is the main method to derive when creating an operator.
      Context is the same dictionary used as when rendering jinja templates.

      Refer to get_template_context for more context.


   .. py:method:: prepare_for_execution()

      Lock task for execution to disable custom action in __setattr__ and
      returns a copy of the task


   .. py:method:: get_serialized_fields()
      :classmethod:

      Stringified DAGs and operators contain exactly these fields.



.. py:function:: poke_mode_only(cls)

   Decorate a subclass of BaseSensorOperator with poke.

   Indicate that instances of this class are only safe to use poke mode.

   Will decorate all methods in the class to assert they did not change
   the mode from 'poke'.

   :param cls: BaseSensor class to enforce methods only use 'poke' mode.
