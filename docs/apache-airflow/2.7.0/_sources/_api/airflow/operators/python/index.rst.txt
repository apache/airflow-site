.. py:function:: is_venv_installed()

   Checks if the virtualenv package is installed via checking if it is on the path or installed as package.

   :return: True if it is. Whichever way of checking it works, is fine.


.. py:function:: task(python_callable = None, multiple_outputs = None, **kwargs)

   Deprecated. Use :func:`airflow.decorators.task` instead.

   Calls ``@task.python`` and allows users to turn a Python function into
   an Airflow task.

   :param python_callable: A reference to an object that is callable
   :param op_kwargs: a dictionary of keyword arguments that will get unpacked
       in your function (templated)
   :param op_args: a list of positional arguments that will get unpacked when
       calling your callable (templated)
   :param multiple_outputs: if set, function return value will be
       unrolled to multiple XCom values. Dict will unroll to xcom values with keys as keys.
       Defaults to False.


.. py:class:: PythonOperator(*, python_callable, op_args = None, op_kwargs = None, templates_dict = None, templates_exts = None, show_return_value_in_logs = True, **kwargs)


   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.models.baseoperator.BaseOperator`

   Executes a Python callable.

   .. seealso::
       For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
       :ref:`howto/operator:PythonOperator`

   When running your callable, Airflow will pass a set of keyword arguments that can be used in your
   function. This set of kwargs correspond exactly to what you can use in your jinja templates.
   For this to work, you need to define ``**kwargs`` in your function header, or you can add directly the
   keyword arguments you would like to get - for example with the below code your callable will get
   the values of ``ti`` and ``next_ds`` context variables.

   With explicit arguments:

   .. code-block:: python

      def my_python_callable(ti, next_ds):
          pass

   With kwargs:

   .. code-block:: python

      def my_python_callable(**kwargs):
          ti = kwargs["ti"]
          next_ds = kwargs["next_ds"]


   :param python_callable: A reference to an object that is callable
   :param op_kwargs: a dictionary of keyword arguments that will get unpacked
       in your function
   :param op_args: a list of positional arguments that will get unpacked when
       calling your callable
   :param templates_dict: a dictionary where the values are templates that
       will get templated by the Airflow engine sometime between
       ``__init__`` and ``execute`` takes place and are made available
       in your callable's context after the template has been applied. (templated)
   :param templates_exts: a list of file extensions to resolve while
       processing templated fields, for examples ``['.sql', '.hql']``
   :param show_return_value_in_logs: a bool value whether to show return_value
       logs. Defaults to True, which allows return value log output.
       It can be set to False to prevent log output of return value when you return huge data
       such as transmission a large amount of XCom to TaskAPI.

   .. py:method:: execute(context)

      This is the main method to derive when creating an operator.

      Context is the same dictionary used as when rendering jinja templates.

      Refer to get_template_context for more context.


   .. py:method:: determine_kwargs(context)


   .. py:method:: execute_callable()

      Calls the python callable with the given arguments.

      :return: the return value of the call.



.. py:class:: BranchPythonOperator(*, python_callable, op_args = None, op_kwargs = None, templates_dict = None, templates_exts = None, show_return_value_in_logs = True, **kwargs)


   Bases: :py:obj:`PythonOperator`, :py:obj:`airflow.models.skipmixin.SkipMixin`

   A workflow can "branch" or follow a path after the execution of this task.

   It derives the PythonOperator and expects a Python function that returns
   a single task_id or list of task_ids to follow. The task_id(s) returned
   should point to a task directly downstream from {self}. All other "branches"
   or directly downstream tasks are marked with a state of ``skipped`` so that
   these paths can't move forward. The ``skipped`` states are propagated
   downstream to allow for the DAG state to fill up and the DAG run's state
   to be inferred.

   .. py:method:: execute(context)

      This is the main method to derive when creating an operator.

      Context is the same dictionary used as when rendering jinja templates.

      Refer to get_template_context for more context.



.. py:class:: ShortCircuitOperator(*, ignore_downstream_trigger_rules = True, **kwargs)


   Bases: :py:obj:`PythonOperator`, :py:obj:`airflow.models.skipmixin.SkipMixin`

   Allows a pipeline to continue based on the result of a ``python_callable``.

   The ShortCircuitOperator is derived from the PythonOperator and evaluates the result of a
   ``python_callable``. If the returned result is False or a falsy value, the pipeline will be
   short-circuited. Downstream tasks will be marked with a state of "skipped" based on the short-circuiting
   mode configured. If the returned result is True or a truthy value, downstream tasks proceed as normal and
   an ``XCom`` of the returned result is pushed.

   The short-circuiting can be configured to either respect or ignore the ``trigger_rule`` set for
   downstream tasks. If ``ignore_downstream_trigger_rules`` is set to True, the default setting, all
   downstream tasks are skipped without considering the ``trigger_rule`` defined for tasks. However, if this
   parameter is set to False, the direct downstream tasks are skipped but the specified ``trigger_rule`` for
   other subsequent downstream tasks are respected. In this mode, the operator assumes the direct downstream
   tasks were purposely meant to be skipped but perhaps not other subsequent tasks.

   .. seealso::
       For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
       :ref:`howto/operator:ShortCircuitOperator`

   :param ignore_downstream_trigger_rules: If set to True, all downstream tasks from this operator task will
       be skipped. This is the default behavior. If set to False, the direct, downstream task(s) will be
       skipped but the ``trigger_rule`` defined for all other downstream tasks will be respected.

   .. py:method:: execute(context)

      This is the main method to derive when creating an operator.

      Context is the same dictionary used as when rendering jinja templates.

      Refer to get_template_context for more context.



.. py:class:: PythonVirtualenvOperator(*, python_callable, requirements = None, python_version = None, use_dill = False, system_site_packages = True, pip_install_options = None, op_args = None, op_kwargs = None, string_args = None, templates_dict = None, templates_exts = None, expect_airflow = True, skip_on_exit_code = None, **kwargs)


   Bases: :py:obj:`_BasePythonVirtualenvOperator`

   Run a function in a virtualenv that is created and destroyed automatically.

   The function (has certain caveats) must be defined using def, and not be
   part of a class. All imports must happen inside the function
   and no variables outside the scope may be referenced. A global scope
   variable named virtualenv_string_args will be available (populated by
   string_args). In addition, one can pass stuff through op_args and op_kwargs, and one
   can use a return value.
   Note that if your virtualenv runs in a different Python major version than Airflow,
   you cannot use return values, op_args, op_kwargs, or use any macros that are being provided to
   Airflow through plugins. You can use string_args though.

   .. seealso::
       For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
       :ref:`howto/operator:PythonVirtualenvOperator`

   :param python_callable: A python function with no references to outside variables,
       defined with def, which will be run in a virtualenv
   :param requirements: Either a list of requirement strings, or a (templated)
       "requirements file" as specified by pip.
   :param python_version: The Python version to run the virtualenv with. Note that
       both 2 and 2.7 are acceptable forms.
   :param use_dill: Whether to use dill to serialize
       the args and result (pickle is default). This allow more complex types
       but requires you to include dill in your requirements.
   :param system_site_packages: Whether to include
       system_site_packages in your virtualenv.
       See virtualenv documentation for more information.
   :param pip_install_options: a list of pip install options when installing requirements
       See 'pip install -h' for available options
   :param op_args: A list of positional arguments to pass to python_callable.
   :param op_kwargs: A dict of keyword arguments to pass to python_callable.
   :param string_args: Strings that are present in the global var virtualenv_string_args,
       available to python_callable at runtime as a list[str]. Note that args are split
       by newline.
   :param templates_dict: a dictionary where the values are templates that
       will get templated by the Airflow engine sometime between
       ``__init__`` and ``execute`` takes place and are made available
       in your callable's context after the template has been applied
   :param templates_exts: a list of file extensions to resolve while
       processing templated fields, for examples ``['.sql', '.hql']``
   :param expect_airflow: expect Airflow to be installed in the target environment. If true, the operator
       will raise warning if Airflow is not installed, and it will attempt to load Airflow
       macros when starting.
   :param skip_on_exit_code: If python_callable exits with this exit code, leave the task
       in ``skipped`` state (default: None). If set to ``None``, any non-zero
       exit code will be treated as a failure.

   .. py:attribute:: template_fields

   .. py:attribute:: template_ext
      :type: Sequence[str]
      :value: ('.txt',)

      

   .. py:method:: execute_callable()

      Calls the python callable with the given arguments.

      :return: the return value of the call.



.. py:class:: ExternalPythonOperator(*, python, python_callable, use_dill = False, op_args = None, op_kwargs = None, string_args = None, templates_dict = None, templates_exts = None, expect_airflow = True, expect_pendulum = False, skip_on_exit_code = None, **kwargs)


   Bases: :py:obj:`_BasePythonVirtualenvOperator`

   Run a function in a virtualenv that is not re-created.

   Reused as is without the overhead of creating the virtualenv (with certain caveats).

   The function must be defined using def, and not be
   part of a class. All imports must happen inside the function
   and no variables outside the scope may be referenced. A global scope
   variable named virtualenv_string_args will be available (populated by
   string_args). In addition, one can pass stuff through op_args and op_kwargs, and one
   can use a return value.
   Note that if your virtualenv runs in a different Python major version than Airflow,
   you cannot use return values, op_args, op_kwargs, or use any macros that are being provided to
   Airflow through plugins. You can use string_args though.

   If Airflow is installed in the external environment in different version that the version
   used by the operator, the operator will fail.,

   .. seealso::
       For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
       :ref:`howto/operator:ExternalPythonOperator`

   :param python: Full path string (file-system specific) that points to a Python binary inside
       a virtualenv that should be used (in ``VENV/bin`` folder). Should be absolute path
       (so usually start with "/" or "X:/" depending on the filesystem/os used).
   :param python_callable: A python function with no references to outside variables,
       defined with def, which will be run in a virtualenv
   :param use_dill: Whether to use dill to serialize
       the args and result (pickle is default). This allow more complex types
       but if dill is not preinstalled in your venv, the task will fail with use_dill enabled.
   :param op_args: A list of positional arguments to pass to python_callable.
   :param op_kwargs: A dict of keyword arguments to pass to python_callable.
   :param string_args: Strings that are present in the global var virtualenv_string_args,
       available to python_callable at runtime as a list[str]. Note that args are split
       by newline.
   :param templates_dict: a dictionary where the values are templates that
       will get templated by the Airflow engine sometime between
       ``__init__`` and ``execute`` takes place and are made available
       in your callable's context after the template has been applied
   :param templates_exts: a list of file extensions to resolve while
       processing templated fields, for examples ``['.sql', '.hql']``
   :param expect_airflow: expect Airflow to be installed in the target environment. If true, the operator
       will raise warning if Airflow is not installed, and it will attempt to load Airflow
       macros when starting.
   :param skip_on_exit_code: If python_callable exits with this exit code, leave the task
       in ``skipped`` state (default: None). If set to ``None``, any non-zero
       exit code will be treated as a failure.

   .. py:attribute:: template_fields
      :type: Sequence[str]

      

   .. py:method:: execute_callable()

      Calls the python callable with the given arguments.

      :return: the return value of the call.



.. py:class:: BranchExternalPythonOperator(*, python, python_callable, use_dill = False, op_args = None, op_kwargs = None, string_args = None, templates_dict = None, templates_exts = None, expect_airflow = True, expect_pendulum = False, skip_on_exit_code = None, **kwargs)


   Bases: :py:obj:`ExternalPythonOperator`, :py:obj:`airflow.models.skipmixin.SkipMixin`

   A workflow can "branch" or follow a path after the execution of this task,
   Extends ExternalPythonOperator, so expects to get Python:
   virtualenv that should be used (in ``VENV/bin`` folder). Should be absolute path,
   so it can run on separate virtualenv similarly to ExternalPythonOperator.

   .. py:method:: execute(context)

      This is the main method to derive when creating an operator.

      Context is the same dictionary used as when rendering jinja templates.

      Refer to get_template_context for more context.



.. py:function:: get_current_context()

   Retrieve the execution context dictionary without altering user method's signature.

   This is the simplest method of retrieving the execution context dictionary.

   **Old style:**

   .. code:: python

       def my_task(**context):
           ti = context["ti"]

   **New style:**

   .. code:: python

       from airflow.operators.python import get_current_context


       def my_task():
           context = get_current_context()
           ti = context["ti"]

   Current context will only have value if this method was called after an operator
   was starting to execute.
