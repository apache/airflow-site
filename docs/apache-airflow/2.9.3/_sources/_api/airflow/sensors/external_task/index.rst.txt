.. py:class:: ExternalDagLink


   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.models.baseoperatorlink.BaseOperatorLink`

   Operator link for ExternalTaskSensor and ExternalTaskMarker.

   It allows users to access DAG waited with ExternalTaskSensor or cleared by ExternalTaskMarker.

   .. py:attribute:: name
      :value: 'External DAG'

      

   .. py:method:: get_link(operator, *, ti_key)

      Link to external system.

      Note: The old signature of this function was ``(self, operator, dttm: datetime)``. That is still
      supported at runtime but is deprecated.

      :param operator: The Airflow operator object this link is associated to.
      :param ti_key: TaskInstance ID to return link for.
      :return: link to external system



.. py:class:: ExternalTaskSensor(*, external_dag_id, external_task_id = None, external_task_ids = None, external_task_group_id = None, allowed_states = None, skipped_states = None, failed_states = None, execution_delta = None, execution_date_fn = None, check_existence = False, poll_interval = 2.0, deferrable = conf.getboolean('operators', 'default_deferrable', fallback=False), **kwargs)


   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.sensors.base.BaseSensorOperator`

   Waits for a different DAG, task group, or task to complete for a specific logical date.

   If both `external_task_group_id` and `external_task_id` are ``None`` (default), the sensor
   waits for the DAG.
   Values for `external_task_group_id` and `external_task_id` can't be set at the same time.

   By default, the ExternalTaskSensor will wait for the external task to
   succeed, at which point it will also succeed. However, by default it will
   *not* fail if the external task fails, but will continue to check the status
   until the sensor times out (thus giving you time to retry the external task
   without also having to clear the sensor).

   By default, the ExternalTaskSensor will not skip if the external task skips.
   To change this, simply set ``skipped_states=[TaskInstanceState.SKIPPED]``.
   Note that if you are monitoring multiple tasks, and one enters error state
   and the other enters a skipped state, then the external task will react to
   whichever one it sees first. If both happen together, then the failed state
   takes priority.

   It is possible to alter the default behavior by setting states which
   cause the sensor to fail, e.g. by setting ``allowed_states=[DagRunState.FAILED]``
   and ``failed_states=[DagRunState.SUCCESS]`` you will flip the behaviour to
   get a sensor which goes green when the external task *fails* and immediately
   goes red if the external task *succeeds*!

   Note that ``soft_fail`` is respected when examining the failed_states. Thus
   if the external task enters a failed state and ``soft_fail == True`` the
   sensor will _skip_ rather than fail. As a result, setting ``soft_fail=True``
   and ``failed_states=[DagRunState.SKIPPED]`` will result in the sensor
   skipping if the external task skips. However, this is a contrived
   example---consider using ``skipped_states`` if you would like this
   behaviour. Using ``skipped_states`` allows the sensor to skip if the target
   fails, but still enter failed state on timeout. Using ``soft_fail == True``
   as above will cause the sensor to skip if the target fails, but also if it
   times out.

   :param external_dag_id: The dag_id that contains the task you want to
       wait for. (templated)
   :param external_task_id: The task_id that contains the task you want to
       wait for. (templated)
   :param external_task_ids: The list of task_ids that you want to wait for. (templated)
       If ``None`` (default value) the sensor waits for the DAG. Either
       external_task_id or external_task_ids can be passed to
       ExternalTaskSensor, but not both.
   :param external_task_group_id: The task_group_id that contains the task you want to
       wait for. (templated)
   :param allowed_states: Iterable of allowed states, default is ``['success']``
   :param skipped_states: Iterable of states to make this task mark as skipped, default is ``None``
   :param failed_states: Iterable of failed or dis-allowed states, default is ``None``
   :param execution_delta: time difference with the previous execution to
       look at, the default is the same logical date as the current task or DAG.
       For yesterday, use [positive!] datetime.timedelta(days=1). Either
       execution_delta or execution_date_fn can be passed to
       ExternalTaskSensor, but not both.
   :param execution_date_fn: function that receives the current execution's logical date as the first
       positional argument and optionally any number of keyword arguments available in the
       context dictionary, and returns the desired logical dates to query.
       Either execution_delta or execution_date_fn can be passed to ExternalTaskSensor,
       but not both.
   :param check_existence: Set to `True` to check if the external task exists (when
       external_task_id is not None) or check if the DAG to wait for exists (when
       external_task_id is None), and immediately cease waiting if the external task
       or DAG does not exist (default value: False).
   :param poll_interval: polling period in seconds to check for the status
   :param deferrable: Run sensor in deferrable mode

   .. py:method:: poke(context, session = NEW_SESSION)

      Override when deriving this class.


   .. py:method:: execute(context)

      Run on the worker and defer using the triggers if deferrable is set to True.


   .. py:method:: execute_complete(context, event=None)

      Execute when the trigger fires - return immediately.


   .. py:method:: get_count(dttm_filter, session, states)

      Get the count of records against dttm filter and states.

      :param dttm_filter: date time filter for execution date
      :param session: airflow session object
      :param states: task or dag states
      :return: count of record against the filters

.. py:class:: ExternalTaskMarker(*, external_dag_id, external_task_id, execution_date = '{{ logical_date.isoformat() }}', recursion_depth = 10, **kwargs)


   Bases: :py:obj:`airflow.operators.empty.EmptyOperator`

   Use this operator to indicate that a task on a different DAG depends on this task.

   When this task is cleared with "Recursive" selected, Airflow will clear the task on
   the other DAG and its downstream tasks recursively. Transitive dependencies are followed
   until the recursion_depth is reached.

   :param external_dag_id: The dag_id that contains the dependent task that needs to be cleared.
   :param external_task_id: The task_id of the dependent task that needs to be cleared.
   :param execution_date: The logical date of the dependent task execution that needs to be cleared.
   :param recursion_depth: The maximum level of transitive dependencies allowed. Default is 10.
       This is mostly used for preventing cyclic dependencies. It is fine to increase
       this number if necessary. However, too many levels of transitive dependencies will make
       it slower to clear tasks in the web UI.
