    - Transfers: 12
    - Sensors: 14
    - Hooks: 37
    - Secrets: 0
- We have 386 classes that were moved. Quite a number of those (hard to say exactly how many) got new features, options, parameters.
    - Operators: 204
    - Transfers: 36

Changelog - https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/8100f1f/CHANGELOG.txt

By default one of Airflow's dependencies installs a GPL dependency (unidecode). To avoid this dependency set **SLUGIFY_USES_TEXT_UNIDECODE=yes** in your environment when you install or upgrade Airflow. To force installing the GPL version set **AIRFLOW_GPL_UNIDECODE**. One of these two environment variables must be specified.

Airbnb will be hosting the very first Airflow meetup at Airbnb HQ (888 Brannan, in SF) on March 28th.

We're planning on doing this regularly, and want to put a good line up of food, drinks and talks for you all.

It should be pretty informal, but here's a draft of the schedule for the night:

- meet, geet and eat
- updates on the project, roadmap & upcoming Airbnb sprints
- present advanced/complex Airbnb Airflow use cases (A/B testing framework, anomaly detection or something of that nature)
- Sid Anand will share about how they use Airflow at Agari
- Q/A for the core project team
- Community open mic, step up and make announcements if you're recruiting, looking for help, planning on working on a feature, ...
- Define list of subjects of interest on a whiteboard for breaking into subject specific subgroups for discussion

Please RSVP here: https://www.airbnb.com/meetups/daywndmbd-airflow

We're planning on starting to have Airflow meetups regularly, so stay tuned!
