We are thrilled to announce the release of **Apache Airflow 3.1.0**, an update that puts humans at the center of data
workflows. This release introduces powerful new capabilities for human decision-making in automated
processes, comprehensive internationalization support, and significant developer experience improvements.

## ü§ù Human-in-the-Loop (HITL): When Automation Meets Human Judgment

This powerful capability bridges the gap between automated processes and human expertise, making Airflow invaluable for:

![Human-in-the-Loop HITL](images/hitl.gif)

* **AI/ML Model Validation**: Pause inference pipelines for human review of model outputs
* **Content Moderation**: Route content through human reviewers before publication
* **Approval Workflows**: Require manager approval for sensitive operations
* **Data Quality Gates**: Allow data stewards to validate critical datasets

**HITL** tasks pause in a deferred state while presenting intuitive web forms in the Airflow UI. Users with appropriate roles can review context data, DAG parameters, and XCom values before making informed decisions.

## Example Code:

```py
from airflow.sdk import DAG
from airflow.providers.standard.operators.hitl import HITLOperator

with DAG("content_moderation", schedule="@daily") as dag:
    moderate_content = HITLOperator(
        task_id="review_content",
        message="Please review this content for publication",
        data_key="content_to_review"
    )
```

# üìä UI Enhancements & Performance

## Calendar and Gantt Views Make Their Comeback

Remember those beloved Calendar and Gantt chart views from Airflow 2.x? They're back, completely rebuilt for the
modern React UI after being omitted from the 3.0 release.

The new Calendar view is genuinely interactive with filtering capabilities that make it easy to drill down
into specific time periods and dag states.

![Calendar View](images/calendar.gif)

The Gantt chart is now integrated directly into the grid view and renders much faster than the old
version, giving you that timeline perspective without the performance headaches.

## Theme Updates That Actually Matter

We've refreshed the color palette using modern design principles, making the UI more consistent, professional
and most of all taken a careful look at contrast ratios so the UI should be more accessible.

## Other Improvements

We've added a lot more filtering options across the pages!

Plus, you can now pin your **favorite DAGs** to keep them at the top of your list or to filter for them easily. It's
one of those small features that makes a huge difference when dealing with 100s of workflows.

> üìä **UI Development Milestone**: Airflow 3.1.0 features **5x more UI pull requests** than the 2.10 release and **50% more** than Airflow 3.0, demonstrating the community's commitment to user experience excellence.

# ‚è∞ **Deadline Alerts**: Proactive Workflow Monitoring

Say goodbye to reactive monitoring. **Deadline Alerts** provide proactive notifications when DAG runs
exceed time thresholds, helping ensure SLA compliance and timely completion of critical workflows.

Configure monitoring by specifying:

* **Reference point**: DAG queued time, logical date, or fixed datetime
* **Interval**: Time threshold (positive or negative)
* **Callback**: Notifications via Airflow Notifiers or custom functions

## Example Code:

```py
from datetime import timedelta
from airflow.sdk.definitions.deadline import DeadlineAlert, DeadlineReference, AsyncCallback
from airflow.providers.slack.notifications.slack_webhook import SlackWebhookNotifier

with DAG(
    "critical_etl",
    deadline=DeadlineAlert(
        reference=DeadlineReference.DAGRUN_QUEUED_AT,
        interval=timedelta(hours=2),
        callback=AsyncCallback(
            SlackWebhookNotifier,
            kwargs={"text": "üö® Critical ETL missed deadline!"}
        )
    )
) as dag:
    # Your tasks here
```

Perfect for monitoring daily ETLs, alerting before critical deadlines, or escalating resource-constrained workflows.

# üåç Going Global with 17 Languages

Airflow now speaks your team's language. Literally. We have added comprehensive internationalization support
for **17 languages**, including Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Spanish and more. The interface detects your
browser preferences automatically, but you can switch languages on the fly without refreshing the page.

![Internationalization Demo](images/i18n-demo.gif)

For our Arabic and Hebrew users, we've built in **proper right-to-left (RTL) support**

The best part? We have made it straightforward for the community to contribute additional languages with clear
contribution guidelines, so this is just the beginning of Airflow's global reach.


# üé® Build *your Airflow*, *your way*

The new **React Plugin System** (**AIP-68**) transforms how you extend Airflow's interface. We have replaced
the old Flask-based approach with a modern toolkit that lets you customize Airflow exactly how your team works.

Want to embed your company's dashboard right in the Airflow UI? Build React applications or iframes that will
render inside Airflow's (nav bar, dashboard, details page, etc). Want to link to your existing tools
seamlessly? Create custom external links to your resources. Want to extend Airflow's API server? Register
FastAPI sub applications and middlewares that fit your specific processes.

The system includes:

* **External Views** for linking to existing tools (external links or embedded iframes)
* **React Applications**  support for rendering external react apps
* **FastAPI Sub Applications** to extend the API server
* **Root Middlewares** for intercepting API requests (even core ones)

We've already seen teams integrate everything from Wikipedia searches to data lineage
visualizations to yes, someone building a snake game to play while waiting on dag runs!

# üîß Enhanced Developer and Authoring Experience

## Task SDK Evolution

Airflow 3.1 advances the decoupling of the **Task SDK** from Airflow Core through improved DAG serialization. While
complete separation arrives in 3.2.0, the foundation enables:

* **Independent Upgrades**: Reduced coordination need between Dag authors and Airflow Ops teams
* **Forward Compatibility**: Dag authors should now write Dags by importing from the **airflow.sdk** namespace for future-proofing. (Naturally, the old imports still work but issue a warning.)
* **Deployment Flexibility**: Better support for separated component deployment

## Python 3.13 Support

Airflow 3.1.0 adds **Python 3.13** support while removing Python 3.9 (end-of-life). The platform now supports Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13.

## Inference Execution

A new streaming API endpoint (**`/dags/{dag_id}/dagRuns/{dag_run_id}/wait`**) allows applications to watch DAG runs
until completion, enabling responsive integration patterns for real-time workflows.

The below example use [`httpx`](https://www.python-httpx.org/async/) to trigger a dag run, and emits the final dag run
state after it finishes:

```py
import asyncio
import json

import httpx

dag_id = "my-dag"

async def create_and_wait(client):
    # Create a dag run...
    r = await client.post(f"https://my-airflow.example.com/api/v2/dags/{dag_id}/dagRuns")
    run_id = r.json()["dag_run_id"]
    async with client.stream(
        "GET",
        f"https://my-airflow.example.com/api/v2/dags/{dag_id}/dagRuns/{run_id}/wait",
    ) as r:
        async for line in r.aiter_lines():
            pass  # You can do progress report here instead.
    print("Dag run state:", json.loads(line.strip())["state"])

async def main():
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        await create_and_wait(client)

asyncio.run(main())
```
