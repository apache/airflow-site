# Apache Airflow Survey 2020

World of data processing tools is growing steadily. Apache Airflow seems to be already considered as
crucial component of this complex ecosystem. We observe steady growth in number of users as well as in
an amount of active contributors. So listening and understanding our community is of high importance.

It's worth to note that the 2020 survey was still mostly about 1.10.X version of Apache Airflow and
possibly many drawbacks were addressed in the 2.0 version that was released in December 2020. But if this
is true, we will learn next year!

## Overview of the user

![](What_best_describes_your_current_occupation.png)

**What best describes your current occupation? (single choice)**

|                     | No. | %     |
| ------------------- | --- | ----- |
| Data Engineer       | 115 | 56.65 |
| Developer           | 28  | 13.79 |
| DevOps              | 17  | 8.37  |
| Solutions Architect | 14  | 6.9   |
| Data Scientist      | 12  | 5.91  |
| Other               | 10  | 4.93  |
| Data Analyst        | 4   | 1.97  |
| Support Engineer    | 3   | 1.48  |

Those results are not a surprise as Airflow is a tool dedicated to data-related tasks. The majority of
our users are data engineers, scientists or analysts. The 2020 results are similar to [those from 2019](https://airflow.apache.org/blog/airflow-survey/) with
visible slight increase in ML use cases.

Additionally, 79% of users uses Airflow on daily basis and 16% interacts with it at least once a week.

**How many people work in your company? (single choice)**

|        | No. | %     |
| ------ | --- | ----- |
| 200+   | 107 | 52.71 |
| 51-200 | 44  | 21.67 |
| 11-50  | 37  | 18.23 |
| 1-10   | 15  | 7.39  |

**How many people in your company use Airflow? (single choice)**

|       | No. | %     |
| ----- | --- | ----- |
| 1-5   | 84  | 41.38 |
| 6-20  | 75  | 36.95 |
| 21-50 | 23  | 11.33 |
| 50+   | 21  | 10.34 |

Airflow is a software that is used and trusted by big companies. We can also see that Airflow can work
fine for teams of different sizes. However, in some cases users may use multiple Airflow instances.

**Are you considering moving to other workflow engines? (single choice)**

|                               | No. | %     |
| ----------------------------- | --- | ----- |
| No, we are happy with Airflow | 174 | 85.71 |
| Yes                           | 29  | 14.29 |

Nearly 1 out of 7 users is considering migrating to other workflow engines. Their decision is usually
justified by need of **easier workflow writing experience** (12.32%), **better UI/UX** and **faster scheduler**
(8.37% both).

While the first point may be addressed by [TaskFlow API](http://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts.html#taskflow-api) in Airflow 2.0 the other two are definitely addressed
in the new major version. And the early feedback from 2.0 users seems to be confirming it.

The alternative engines considered by users are mainly Prefect and Argo. Some participants also mentioned
Luigi, Kubeflow or custom solutions.

**Are you or your team actively participating in Airflow development - contributing? (single choice)**

|                 | No. | %     |
| --------------- | --- | ----- |
| I wish we could | 99  | 48.77 |
| No              | 59  | 29.06 |
| Yes             | 45  | 22.17 |

This is really heart-warming result. It means that 1 out of 5 users contributes actively to our project!
But it would be good to learn if there's something else than time that is stopping people who wish to contribute
from doing it. If there are some other obstacles we definitely would like to learn about them so we can improve.
That said - if you know something we can improve please reach out via Slack, dev list or Github
discussions.

**How likely are you to recommend Apache Airflow? (single choice)**

|               | No. | 2020 % | 2019 % |
| ------------- | --- | ------ | ------ |
| Very Likely   | 125 | 61.58  | 45.45% |
| Likely        | 62  | 30.54  | 40.26% |
| Neutral       | 11  | 5.42   | 10.71% |
| Unlikely      | 3   | 1.48   | 2.60%  |
| Very unlikely | 2   | 0.99   | 0.97%  |

Here is good news! It seems that people are more willing to recommend Apache Airflow than year before.

**What is your source of information about Airflow? (multiple choice)**

|                                   | No. | %     |

| Other                             | 15  | 7.39  |

Here we see that Airflow documentation is the crucial source of information. What's interesting is that more
than 60% of users are getting information from Github and Slack channels.

## Deployment

**How many active DAGs do you have in your largest Airflow instance? (open question)**

| Number of DAGs | No. | %   |
| -------------- | --- | --- |
| < 20           | 64  | 32  |
| 21-40          | 33  | 16  |
| 41-60          | 13  | 6   |
| 61-100         | 32  | 16  |
| 101-200        | 31  | 15  |
| 201-300        | 8   | 4   |
| 301-999        | 12  | 6   |
| 1000+          | 10  | 5   |

**What is the maximum number of tasks that you have used in one DAG? (open question)**

| Number of DAGs | No. | %   |
| -------------- | --- | --- |
| < 10           | 42  | 21  |
| 11-20          | 31  | 15  |
| 21-30          | 15  | 7   |
| 31-40          | 11  | 5   |
| 41-50          | 22  | 11  |
| 51-100         | 39  | 19  |
| 101-200        | 16  | 8   |
| 201-500        | 16  | 8   |
| 501+           | 11  | 5   |

**Which version of Airflow do you use currently? (single choice)**

|                 | No. | %     |
| --------------- | --- | ----- |
| 1.10.14         | 55  | 27.09 |
| 2.0.0+          | 45  | 22.17 |
| 1.10.12         | 27  | 13.3  |
| 1.10.10         | 26  | 12.81 |
| 1.10.11         | 14  | 6.9   |
| 1.10.5 or older | 10  | 4.93  |
| 1.10.9          | 8   | 3.94  |
| 1.10.13         | 7   | 3.45  |
| 1.10.6          | 4   | 1.97  |
| 1.10.7          | 4   | 1.97  |
| 1.10.8          | 3   | 1.48  |

This was probably one of the most important questions in the survey. While it's good to see
that more than 60% of users use one of three latest Airflow versions, it's worrying that the rest
are using versions that are old or have known security vulnerabilities.

Additionally, more than 20% of users are already using 2.0.0+ versions which is reasonably good information.

**What meta-database do you use? (single choice)**

|              | No. | %     |
| ------------ | --- | ----- |
| Postgres 12  | 36  | 17.73 |
| Postgres 9.6 | 33  | 16.26 |
| Postgres 11  | 31  | 15.27 |
| MySQL 5.7    | 27  | 13.3  |
| MySQL 8.0    | 20  | 9.85  |
| Postgres 10  | 20  | 9.85  |
| Other        | 19  | 9.36  |
| Postgres 13  | 18  | 8.87  |

This means that more about 69% of users decide to use Postgres as their meta-database.
MySQL is the choice of nearly 24% users. The other responses included some MySQL versions
like MariaDB or cloud hosted database like Cloud SQL (used by Google Composer) or AWS Aurora.

It's good to know that users rather avoid using SQLite in production deployments!

**What executor type do you use? (single choice)**

![](What_executor_type_do_you_use.png)

|            | No. | 2020   | 2019   |
| ---------- | --- | ------ | ------ |
| Celery     | 100 | 49.26% | 44.81% |
| Kubernetes | 48  | 23.65% | 16.88% |
| Local      | 40  | 19.7%  | 27.60% |
| Sequential | 10  | 4.93%  | 7.14%  |
| Other      | 5   | 2.46%  | 3.57   |

In comparison to previous year it seems that more users use currently Celery and
Kubernetes executors and LocalExecutor usage dropped by nearly 8 points. This may
suggest that users' deployments are growing, and they need more scalable solutions.

Among CeleryExecutor users 78% use Redis as a broker, 19% use RabbitMQ and the rest
is using other brokers or is not sure what is used in their deployments.

**What metrics do you use to monitor Airflow? (multiple choice)**

|                               | No. | %     |
| ----------------------------- | --- | ----- |
| I do not use monitoring       | 65  | 32.02 |
| External monitoring service   | 60  | 29.56 |
| Information from metadatabase | 51  | 25.12 |
| Statsd                        | 49  | 24.14 |
| Other                         | 31  | 15.27 |

The other responses included mostly information about tools used by users
including DataDog and Prometheus exporter.

**How do you deploy Airflow? (single choice)**

|                                                                      | No. | %     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | ----- |
| On virtual machines (for example using AWS EC2)                      | 64  | 31.53 |
| Using a managed service like Astronomer, Google Composer or AWS MWAA | 35  | 17.24 |
| On Kubernetes (using custom deployments)                             | 29  | 14.29 |
| On premises                                                          | 28  | 13.79 |
| On Kubernetes (using another helm chart)                             | 20  | 9.85  |
| On Kubernetes (using Apache Airflow's helm chart)                    | 17  | 8.37  |
| Other                                                                | 12  | 5.91  |

Nearly 33% of users deploys Airflow using some kind of Kubernetes deployment. This is about
10 percent more than in 2019. There's slightly increase in usage of Airflow via
managed services (14.61% in 2019).

**Do you use containerisation for deployment? (single choice)**

|                                    | No. | %     |
| ---------------------------------- | --- | ----- |
| Yes, using helm chart / kubernetes | 58  | 28.57 |
| No, I donâ€™t use containerisation   | 57  | 28.08 |
| Yes, single docker image           | 49  | 24.14 |
| Yes, using docker compose          | 39  | 19.21 |

Among users who do not use Kubernetes based deployments 58% of them use containerisation. About
42% of those users use docker-compose for deployments.

**How do you distribute your DAGs? (single choice)**

|                                                         | No. | %     |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --- | ----- |
| Using a synchronizing process (Git sync, GCS fuse, etc) | 79  | 38.92 |
| Bake them into the docker image                         | 56  | 27.59 |
| Shared files system                                     | 34  | 16.75 |
| Other                                                   | 20  | 9.85  |
| I donâ€™t know                                            | 14  | 6.9   |

The most popular way of distributing DAGs seems to be using a synchronizing process. About
40% of users use this process together with Kubernetes deployments.

## Summary

From an open-source point of view, it is good to see that many people would love to contribute to Apache Airflow.
This means that there are resources that if unleashed may make our community even stronger. From a product perspective, it is important to know that users are usually using the latest versions of our software and
are willing to upgrade to new ones.

Finally, there are still some things to improve - documentation, onboarding guides and plug-and-play airflow
deployments. However, we hope that with the increase of adoption there will be an increase in people willing
to share their experience and tools.
