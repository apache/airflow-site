<h4>Community Code of Conduct</h4>
<p>All Airflow Community groups abide by
  <a target="_blank" href="https://apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct">
    The Apache Software Foundation’s (ASF) Code of Conduct
  </a>. Below, please find a breakdown of how that code applies to Airflow Slack and in-person Meetups</p>

<h4>Airflow Slack Guidelines</h4>
<p>
  <strong>Airflow Slack abides by
  </strong>
      <strong>The Apache Foundation’s Code of Conduct</strong>
    </span>
  </a>
  <strong>. In addition to those primary guidelines, these policies are specifically for Airflow Slack.</strong>

  <p>The Airflow Slack community contains 40,000+ members and continues to grow. Because this community is run by the very practitioners who build in Airflow daily, our members feel a sense of camaraderie, ownership, and comfortability here.
    &nbsp;</p>
  <p>Our mission is to preserve the integrity of this community. So along with our members, we have codified what it means to be a valuable participant in Airflow Slack. Thank you for reviewing our guidelines, and by doing so helping to grow a community we can all call home.</p>

      <strong>Channel Guidelines</strong>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>There are 75+ Channels in the Airflow Slack Community. To view them all, please select “Browse Channels”. Only post in a Channel if the information is pertinent to that channel. If you are unsure if you should be posting in a specific channel, please go to “Browse Channels” to see if there is a more relevant space to post. Please note that Airflow Slack Community members help on a volunteer basis during their free time. So, we encourage all Airflow Slack members to be patient when asking a question in a channel. When posting in channels in the Airflow Slack community, it's important to maintain a respectful and productive atmosphere. Here are some things to keep in mind:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Make It Easy to Help You:
      </strong>When posting a question, make sure you have done your research on the topic prior to posting. Provide as much information as you can, including documentation, your tech stack, and anything else you think will be helpful. In a nutshell, do not ask just to ask. Ask with the intention of making it easy for others to help you.
      <a target="_blank" href="https://dontasktoask.com/">
      </a>.
      &nbsp;</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Stay On-Topic:</strong>
      Ensure that your messages are relevant to the specific channel's purpose. Avoid posting unrelated content or engaging in off-topic discussions that could clutter the channel and distract community members from the main focus of the conversation. Avoid hijacking existing threads that are discussing a similar topic that you planned to post. Instead, start a new thread about your topic. Most problems are nuanced and different, so it’s important to separate them to avoid confusion.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Use Descriptive and Informative Titles:</strong>
      When starting a new discussion or asking a question, use clear and descriptive titles or subjects that provide context. This helps other members quickly understand the nature of your message and whether they can contribute or benefit from it.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Respect Community Guidelines and Etiquette:</strong>
      Follow the guidelines and
      <a target="_blank" href="https://apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct">
      </a>
      established by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Be respectful, polite, and considerate in your interactions. Avoid using offensive language, making personal attacks, or engaging in any form of harassment. Encourage constructive discussions and collaboration among members.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Avoid Spammy Behavior:</strong>
      Refrain from excessive or unsolicited marketing messages, sales pitches, or product advertisements. Use private messages for one-on-one conversations about your offerings, and only when community members express interest.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By adhering to these rules, you can contribute positively to the Airflow Slack community, promote productive discussions, and maintain a welcoming and respectful environment for all participants.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
      <strong>Spamming</strong>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>Any person spamming within the Airflow Slack Community will immediately have their Slack account inactivated. Spamming includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Posting links in channels advertising something for personal gain that is not related to Airflow.</li>
    <li>Direct messaging members with the intent to sell.</li>
    <li>Posting the same link and/or message multiple times.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
      <strong>Vendors</strong>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>Vendors are an important part of the Airflow ecosystem. However, given that this is an open source community, we have strict guidelines for how to engage as a vendor within this community. If you are a vendor, please review carefully:&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Transparency is Key: Always clearly identify yourself as a vendor or representative of your company in your Slack username or profile information. This transparency helps community members understand your affiliation and intentions.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Respect the Community's Focus:</strong>
      Ensure that your posts align with the Apache Airflow community's primary goal of discussing, sharing knowledge, and solving issues related to Airflow. Avoid excessive self-promotion or off-topic discussions.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Provide Value First:</strong>
      Focus on delivering value to the community before promoting your products or services. Contribute by answering questions, providing insights, or sharing helpful resources related to Apache Airflow.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Follow the Code of Conduct:</strong>
      Adhere to the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct">
        Apache Software Foundation's Code of Conduct
      </a>. Be respectful, courteous, and patient in your interactions, and avoid any form of harassment or discrimination.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Remember that the Airflow Slack community is a place for open discussion, collaboration, and learning. By following these rules and engaging positively, you can build trust and credibility within the community while representing your company in a respectful and constructive manner.</p>
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
      <strong>Direct Messages</strong>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>Sending direct messages (DMs) in the Airflow Slack community can be a valuable way to engage in one-on-one conversations and seek assistance. However, it's crucial to maintain professionalism and respect others' boundaries. Here are five rules to follow when sending DMs in the Airflow Slack community:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Respect Consent and Privacy:
      </strong>We encourage you to ask for permission before initiating a direct message conversation with another community member. Unsolicited DMs can be seen as intrusive, so respect their decision if they decline or do not respond.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Keep Troubleshooting Questions Public:
      </strong>Kindly avoid seeking troubleshooting or asking questions via private messages for three key reasons. Firstly, public discussions promote shared learning, benefiting all members. Secondly, by posting questions openly, you allow others to offer their assistance. Lastly, our community thrives on mutual support; private messages may strain volunteers. Embracing open discussions preserves our helpful and resourceful environment.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Stay on Topic:</strong>
      Keep your DM conversations focused on relevant topics related to Apache Airflow or community-related discussions. Avoid using DMs for personal or unrelated matters.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Be Courteous and Professional:</strong>
      Maintain a polite and respectful tone in your DMs, just as you would in public channels. Avoid using offensive language, making personal attacks, or engaging in any form of harassment.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Avoid Spam and Unsolicited Promotion:</strong>
      Do not use DMs to spam or excessively promote products, services, or solicitations. Only share information or offers when the recipient has shown a genuine interest or consented to receive such messages.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Use Group DMs Appropriately:</strong>
      When creating group DMs, ensure that all participants are interested in the conversation's topic and that it remains relevant to the community. Respect the privacy and preferences of all participants.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Remember that direct messages should be used as a tool for collaboration, seeking assistance, or engaging in constructive discussions privately. By following these rules, you can maintain a positive and respectful environment when using DMs within the Apache Airflow Slack community.</p>
  <p>
    <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
