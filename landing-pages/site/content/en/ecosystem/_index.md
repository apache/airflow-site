## Tools integrating with Airflow

[afctl](https://github.com/qubole/afctl) - A CLI tool that includes everything required to create, manage and deploy airflow projects faster and smoother.

[airflow-code-editor](https://github.com/andreax79/airflow-code-editor) - A plugin for Apache Airflow that allows you to edit DAGs in browser.

[airflow-diagrams](https://github.com/feluelle/airflow-diagrams) - Auto-generated Diagrams from Airflow DAGs

[airflow-maintenance-dags](https://github.com/teamclairvoyant/airflow-maintenance-dags) - [Clairvoyant](https://clairvoyantsoft.com/) has a repo of Airflow DAGs that operator on Airflow itself, clearing out various bits of the backing metadata store.

[AirflowK8sDebugger](https://github.com/Javier162380/AirflowKuberentesDebugger) - A library for generate k8s pod yaml templates from an Airflow dag using the KubernetesPodOperator.

[Airflow Ditto](https://github.com/angadsingh/airflow-ditto) - An extensible framework to do transformations to an Airflow DAG and convert it into another DAG which is flow-isomorphic with the original DAG, to be able to run it on different environments (e.g. on different clouds, or even different container frameworks - Apache Spark on YARN vs Kubernetes). Comes with out-of-the-box support for EMR-to-HDInsight-DAG transforms.

[Airflow ECR Plugin](https://github.com/asandeep/airflow-ecr-plugin) - Plugin to refresh AWS ECR login token at regular intervals. This is helpful where DockerOperator needs to pull images hosted on ECR.
