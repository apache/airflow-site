## Why use Airflow for Business Operations?

</br>

Airflow is trusted and tested by many companies to deliver their data on time. Airflow is a popular choice to build your business upon, because it is:

- **Tool agnostic**: Using Airflow future-proofs your business, as it can be used to orchestrate actions in any external tool or service, which means you can always switch to the newest and best tools, without needing to change your whole orchestration layer.
- **Extensible**: There are many Airflow modules available to connect to popular data tools, and you can write your own custom operators and hooks for specific use cases.
- **Dynamic**: In Airflow you can define [dynamic tasks](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/authoring-and-scheduling/dynamic-task-mapping.html), which serve as placeholders to adapt at runtime based on changing input.
- **Scalable**: Airflow can be scaled to handle infinite numbers of tasks and workflows, given enough computing power. If you choose Airflow your business will be able to grow with it.
