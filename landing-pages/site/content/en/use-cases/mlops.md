# Use Airflow for Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)

</div>

</br>

Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is a broad term encompassing everything needed to run machine learning models in production. MLOps is a rapidly evolving field with many different best practices and behavioral patterns, with Apache Airflow providing tool agnostic orchestration capabilities for all steps. An emerging subset of MLOps is Large Language Model Operations (LLMOps), which focuses on developing pipelines around applications of large language models like GPT-4 or Command.

The following video shows the real pipeline powering the Airflow Q&A application [Ask Astro](ask.astronomer.io). The full source code for this example can be found [here](https://github.com/astronomer/ask-astro).
