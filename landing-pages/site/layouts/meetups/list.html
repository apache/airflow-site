            Meetups related to the Apache Airflow project are held across the globe, thanks to community volunteers. Interested individuals are encouraged to host community meetups using the name Apache Airflow Meetup <geographical location> in compliance with Apache Software Foundation's branding and trademarks guidelines. No explicit PMC approval is required but also, PMC does not endorse the organizers or communities that organize it.
            <p/><p/>
            Hosts are required to ensure that:

            <ul>
                <li>The Apache Airflow ecosystem should be championed in every meetup and technical session</li>
                <li>All talks should be vendor-neutral and not sales pitches</li>
                <li>Each meetup should strive to have at least two talks with speakers representing different companies/organizations if possible to foster neutrality</li>
                <li>Planned meetups should be brought to the attention of the Airflow dev mailing list</li>
                <li>All Community Guidelines must be respected including the <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/code-of-conduct/">Code of conduct</a></li>
